The "Casualties" metric counts the number of actors who were categorized as Casualties on any day during the given hurricane.

The "Unconstrained" prescription was implemented in combination with the government's baseline strategy. The "Constrained" prescription was implemented in place of the government's baseline aid strategy.

The metric for the short-term "Individual" prescription was based on the most severe injury suffered by the target actor over the course of the hurricane.

For the offseason prescriptions, we assumed that the reinforcement was for the union across the demographic groups (e.g., all atheists' homes are reinforced, all ethnic minorities' homes, and all old people's), not the intersection (e.g., only the homes of old atheists of the ethnic minority are reinforced).

We interpreted "old" as the oldest 10% of the population.

We interpreted the evacuation information campaign as 100% successful.
