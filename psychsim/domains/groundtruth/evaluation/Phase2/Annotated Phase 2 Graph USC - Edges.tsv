41	ActorBeliefOfRegion's risk	ActorBeliefOfActor's risk	often	For actor's staying at home, a higher risk level in their region of residence leads to a higher level of personal risk	actor		All actors had the same accurate beliefs about this dependency, but could differ in their beliefs about the category (source node) and consequently the risk of their home region (target node)
