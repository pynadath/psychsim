# Specific question #

In Question 7 of TA2A-TA1C-0712, does a value of 1 correspond to no aid received or a small amount of aid received?

Also, which specific regions receive government-provided aid?


# Other applicable details #

# Answer # 

We used a 7-point Likert scale, so no aid received corresponds to 1.

Unless we're misinterpreting the second question, it sounds like a repeat of TA2A-TA1C-0582.
