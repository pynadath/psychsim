# Research method category #

Brief from expert observers

# Specific question #
During each timestep of the hurricane, how much aid was distributed to each of the 16 regions regions in instance 22? Please provide a separate table for each of the eight hurricanes in this instance:
Hurricane 1
Hurricane 2
Hurricane 3
Hurricane 4
Hurricane 5
Hurricane 6
Hurricane 7
Hurricane 8


# Sampling strategy #

The expert observers visit each region during each hurricane and during the aftermath of each hurricane in the IDP, until the next hurricane to hit that region. That is to say, if a hurricane affected region 3 in timesteps 2-4, and the next hurricane in that region began in timestep 13, an expert observer would report on the damage in Region 3 in each of the timesteps beginning at step 2 and ending at step 12. The observers will provide a separate table with responses for the aid-related questions for each such hurricane-region pair.
