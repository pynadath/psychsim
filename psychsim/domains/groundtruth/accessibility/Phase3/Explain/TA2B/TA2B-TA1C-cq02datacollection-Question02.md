# Specific question # 


Q1. We wanted to double check two of the answers for TA2B-TA1C-answerability-Question01 
We had asked if the following were answerable by agents:
“2. Have you been the victim of a robbery?” No
“10. Do you know anyone (including yourself) who has been the victim of a robbery?” Yes


We want to check if both of these answers are correct, as they seem mutually contradictory


Q2. Are additional simulation instances accessible in this phase? If so, what limits do we have on requesting IDP’s or similar datasets from additional instances?


Q3. Is social media data collection available? That is, can we collect large samples of online interactions?


Q4. Where and when can we post observers? That is, what are the restrictions on where they can do their monitoring? What are the restrictions on what they can report on? Are they limited by weather restrictions?


Q5. When agents report on their friends, is there some other sort of relationship that they are not reporting on? For example, if an agent says that they have exactly 1 friend, is it possible that they also interact regularly with other individuals who perhaps live near them that they are not reporting in their friend contacts list?


Q6. Would agents be able to separately and distinguishably answer questions about 
1. the people they interact with
2. the people they have ongoing interactions with
3. the people they regard as friends
4. the people they trust
5. the type of friendship relation being represented (peer, confidant, romantic partner, acquaintance?)


Q7. Aside from “friendship”, which of the following relationship types can agents recognize: coworker, family, neighbor, co-member of organization, or co-resident of a region?


Q8. Can agents distinguish among the following concepts:
Risk to own person
Risk to dependents
Risk to pets
Risk to wealth
Risk to property/holdings
Risk to their region
Risk to their ethnic group
Risk to their religious group
Risk to another organization
Risk to the government


# Other applicable details #


# Answer #

Q1. Those answers are correct.

Q2. Yes. Each request can ask for a single instance. 

Q3. Data are not available that distinguish online interactions. Actors can be queried about their interactions, but there is no central repository of such data.

Q4. We do not have any a priori restrictions in place, although it is possible that there are unreasonable monitoring stations that we have not anticipated.

Q5. It is possible.

Q6. We cannot answer directly about distinguishability, but the actors can answer questions on all items.

Q7. Data are available for all except coworker.

Q8. This is not directly answerable. Actors can be surveyed on these concepts, if desired.
