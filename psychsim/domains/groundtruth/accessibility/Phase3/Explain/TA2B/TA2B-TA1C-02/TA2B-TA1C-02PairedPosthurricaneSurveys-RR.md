Survey


# Specific question #
We would like to collect the post-hurricane surveys on the same participants as were included in the Explain IDP, but asking each participant to fill out one additional post-hurricane survey for the hurricane that occurred directly after the one that they already filled. We call this a paired survey because we are seeking responses that relate to adjacent hurricanes. If the respondent is deceased and cannot fill the survey for the subsequent hurricane, report this in the dataset including their IDP identification string and the tag ‘deceased’. (If information is available on the date of their death please include that in the decedent report, as well as any info about where they died whether it be at home or in the government shelter or while evacuated from the area.) 


Survey Data: We expect the firm conducting the pre- and post- hurricane surveys to use the same set of linked participant IDs as are in the IDP. 


5. ActorPostTable: Actor-level survey, conducted after a hurricane has passed:
a. Participant: ID for participant.
b. Hurricane: Identifying number of hurricane (first hurricane is 1).
d. Survey questions:
i. At shelter: Did you stay at a public shelter at any point during the last
hurricane?
ii. Evacuated: Did you stay outside the area at any point during the last
hurricane?
iii. Injured: Were you injured at any point during the last hurricane?
iv. Risk: The last hurricane posed a significant risk to myself and my family.
(Response on a 1-7 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly
agree”)
v. Dissatisfaction: The government response to the last hurricane was unfair
and inadequate. (Response on a 1-7 scale, ranging from “strongly
disagree” to “strongly agree”)
vi. Shelter possibility: (If answer to i. is “no”) I considered moving to a public
shelter during the last hurricane. (Response on a 1-7 scale, ranging from
“strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)
vii. Evacuation possibility: (If answer to ii. is “no”) I considered evacuating
the area during the last hurricane. (Response on a 1-7 scale, ranging from
“strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)
viii. Stay at home possibility: (If you stayed at a public shelter or outside the
area on at least one day during the last hurricane) I considered staying at
home throughout the last hurricane. (Response on a 1-7 scale, ranging
from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)


# Sampling strategy #


Recruit the same participants as those that responded to pre-hurricane surveys in the IDP. For each recruit, have them fill a pre-hurricane survey for the next hurricane that occurs in the season. We call this a paired survey because we are seeking responses that relate to adjacent hurricanes.
