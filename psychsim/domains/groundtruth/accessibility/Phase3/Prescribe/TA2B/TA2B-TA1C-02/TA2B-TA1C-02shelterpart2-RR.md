# Specific question #


We would like to ask each person various questions about their hurricane experience and decision making process. We request the Actor IDs match the ones provided in the Prescribe IDP datasets.


Questions:


Please rate, on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being “Definitely would not shelter” and 10 being “Definitely would shelter”, how likely you would have been to go to a shelter during all previous hurricanes for each of the following conditions: 


1. I knew disease was present in the shelter.
2. I knew disease was not present in the shelter.
3. I knew the shelter was at capacity.
4. I knew the shelter was not at capacity.


# Sampling strategy #


Please recruit the largest percentage of the population in each of the two Prescribe areas that is allowed uniformly at random from the total population of each.


# Other applicable detail #


If answers for every hurricane are not allowed, please provide answers for the maximum number of hurricanes allowed.
