# Specific question #


Q1. What types of interventions are allowed in answers to the unconstrained prescribe questions? Below is a list of possible intervention types with subtypes, for each type / subtype, please list if it’s allowed or not allowed and provide any detailed considerations on the use of that sort of intervention if there are rules/limitations for that type of intervention. 


A. Financial interventions
   1. Provide aid to the entire population; that is, giving the same aid that would have gone to just one region to every one of the 16 regions on every time-step.
   2. Provide aid only to residents that have a specific demographic profile (could be by ethnicity, religion, wealth strata, number of dependents, age, etc.). If this intervention is an option, does it increase the number of regions that can receive aid at once? Can a similar number of individuals be given aid in multiple regions using this selection criteria?
   3. Provide all of the aid budget to just one specific individual.  If this is available, does that increase the amount of aid or the effectiveness of the aid to that individual?
   4. Taxing specific demographic subsets (could be by ethnicity, religion, wealth strata, number of dependents, age, etc.). If this intervention is an option, does it affect the available budget for aid that can be generated from the tax policy? Or, alternatively, are the feasibility of tax and aid policies considered to be independent from each other? 
   5. Taxing regions differently (that is, can each region experience a different tax policy?)
   6. Taxing just one specific individual
   7. Tax residents based on income (as opposed to property/wealth)
   8. Could we provide a financial incentive for a particular behavior, such as evacuating. For example, can we implement a program where an individual that evacuates when a hurricane is in any of the 16 regions is compensated with the average work income they receive on non-hurricane days during the entire time that the hurricane is over land in those 16 regions?
   9. Forcing people to pay into an evacuation fund (like unemployment) where people collect on the fund when they evacuate for a hurricane
   10. Provide universal basic income to every agent
   11. Provide universal basic income to every household that is a function of the number of people in the household
   12. Increasing the amount of aid by a specific percentage (i.e. 50%, 100%)
   13. Redistribution of wealth; that is, can we pool all wealth in the 16-region area and redistribute to each and every household such that all households end up with identical wealth after the redistribution event?
   14. If none of the specific tax scenarios described so far are allowed, then are there any tax scenarios that would be allowed or is it that taxation isn’t allowed in any scenario?
B. Logistical Interventions
   1. Relocating agents between Regions
   2. Relocating agents between Areas
   3. Improving transportation (to remove any potential difficulties for evacuating or sheltering)
   4. Improving shelters (e.g. providing pet facilities so people with pets can bring them to the shelter)
   5. Increasing the number of shelters
   6. Disincentivizing staying home (e.g. with loud continuous sirens)
C. Demographic Interventions
   1. Targeted evacuation / sheltering campaigns for specific demographics (e.g. older agents)
D. Information / Influence interventions
   1. Information campaigns distributing information about the benefits of sheltering or evacuating
   2. Information campaigns combined with a national weather center providing more accurate information about strength, severity, and predicted path of each upcoming hurricane
   3. Influence campaigns using referral sampling methods to encourage friends and neighbors to shelter or evacuate
E. Science Interventions
   1. Create a National Weather Service that accurately reports prior to landfall what the category of every oncoming hurricane will be, as well as the estimated storm track.
F. Legal Interventions
   1. Pass a law making it mandatory to evacuate or shelter under particular circumstances and having the government announce to households when evacuation or sheltering is mandated
G. Pharmaceutical Interventions
   1. Issue psychoactive drugs that are known to the doctors of that world to increase the risk aversion of individuals such that they are exceedingly likely to evacuate in the face of any hurricane.
H. Domicile construction improvements
   1. Pass code regulations requiring housing to become storm resistant so that deaths and injuries are avoided
   2. Issue gov rebate checks to pay for housing repairs for storm resistant housing improvements. 


Q2. For actions related to financial interventions in Q1, what is the intervention budget. is there a quantifiable budget? If there is one, what would it be at the current tax levels? If there is a budget, how would the budget be changeable with changes to tax policy? If there is not a quantitative budget, then are the general guidelines on feasibility or should all combined intervention plans be checked with a clarification question? If budget estimates are non-notional, how can we compute the taxes that would be collected for a given tax policy? Are taxes only permitted to be income or wealth taxes? Are there precise income figures per household? If precise income figures are not available and a method for tax revenue estimation is not reportable to us, is there an entity to which we can submit a proposed tax policy that would produce estimates of revenue generation for us?


Q3. Please list all allowable government actions

# Answer #

Q1.

   A. 

      1. Yes, the amount of aid given to each region would then be 1/16 of the amount currently given to a single region.

      2. Yes, the amount of aid given to each resident would be the amount currently given to a single region divided evenly among those residents fitting the profile (whether or not they are in the same region).

      3. Yes, but this does not change the total amount of aid given, only to whom it is given.

      4. Yes, the amount of resources would be added to the available aid budget.

      5. Yes.

      6. Yes.

      7. Yes.

      8. Yes.

      9. Yes.

      10. Yes.

      11. Yes.

      12. Not without some mechanism of increasing the resources available to provide the additional aid.

      13. Yes.

      14. N/A

   B.

      1. This is allowable, but is not technically feasible within the limited time available for the evaluation.

      2. No.

      3. Yes.

      4. Yes.

      5. Yes.

      6. Yes.

   C.

      1. Yes.

   D. 

      1. Yes.

      2. Yes.

      3. Yes.

   E.

      1. Yes.

   F.

      1. No, though you could pass a law specifying a concrete penalty for certain behaviors.

   G.

      1. Yes.

   H.

      1. No

      2. Yes.

Q2. There is no quantifiable budget; your intervention changes the budget relative to the current budget used in the IDP. The more people taxed or the more wealth taken from them, the greater the budget increase. If you wish to achieve a certain proportional increase in budget, you could specify numbers in terms of the desired increase (e.g., tax all members of the minority religion a uniform percentage that will achieve a 10% increase in aid efficacy). 

Q3. We will not provide such an enumerated list, as we do not wish to limit your thinking by providing one. Your question here contains actions that would not have been in an a priori list of government actions. But upon consideration, there are actions in your list that are easily implemented.
