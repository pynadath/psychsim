# Specific question #
We have observed what we believe to be an error in the Phase I data:

In the Phase I full IDP, the variables 'Actor-decreaseRisk-Region' and 'Actor-takeResources-Region' always have the value 'no'. Is this an error? We believe that there should be people decreasing risk, as well as taking resources.

If there are any problems caused by this error in other columns, could you please fix those as well?


# Other applicable details #

# Answer # 

These data are correct.
