# Specific question # 


Q1. In the Phase 3 Predict questions you refer to a target actor for Instance 23 identified by its EntityIdx, in RunDataTable. We were not able to find a target actor entry in the Instance 23 data. Could you please clarify the ID of the target actor?


Q2. In the answer to TA2B-TA1C-ambiguousValues-Question1.md, you mentioned “We have updated the data packages, both the full data for the Explain instance and the IDP for the Predict instances. The new archives include a README, but we include the text here, as they answer your questions above”
However, we have not received an updated set of zip files for the Explain and Predict Instances. Could you please resend these?

Both questions should be resolved by the R1 data files.
