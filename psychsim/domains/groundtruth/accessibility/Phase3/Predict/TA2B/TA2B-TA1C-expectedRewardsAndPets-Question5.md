# Specific question #


Q1. In the latest update, Phase3_Predict_IDP_TA1C_R2.zip, the “Actor's Expected Reward” is missing for certain actor-timesteps, and the missingness is not explained by being deceased.  
For example, Actor1337 in instance 23, the Expected Rewards are listed for timesteps 2-165, but is missing for time-step 9. The total number of missing actor-timesteps is: 27,750. 
Are these data omissions intended? If not, could we receive the missing information?


Q2.
We have noticed that the “Actor's pet” variable is missing for certain actor-timesteps as well and is also not explained by the actor being deceased. In both instances the “Actor’s pet” variable has reports of being true or false, but then is frequently missing.


For Instance24 we have reports where the value of “Actor’s pet” can be either true or false and there are 86,544 missing reports.


For Instance23 in the updated data we have no reports at all of the value of “Actor’s pet” being false, and there are 199694 missing reports.


We have confirmed that the reports do not appear to be indicating status changes only.


Please clarify these omissions, and, if applicable, send the missing information.
