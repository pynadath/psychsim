# Specific question #


Q1.
We lack any reports on how many children/dependents each household has. Is this data missing from the IDP? We were able to collect this information in the past. Has this data been overlooked in the delivery?


Q2.
The actor join group and leave group data does not correlate to the RelationshipDataTable that provides the members of each group. Please clarify this discrepancy.


Q3.
Capacity for each of the 2 shelters is listed as 100 (and reported as a dynamic integer). However, shelters frequently have more than their listed capacity. Please confirm if capacity is the maximum number of households a shelter can hold or if it is a recommended number it can hold or something else.
