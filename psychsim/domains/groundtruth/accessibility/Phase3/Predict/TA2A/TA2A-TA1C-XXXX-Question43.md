# Specific question #

In response to Phase IÕs TA2A-TA1C-0042-RR, we were given a table called 'TA2A-TA1C-0042Prediction.tsv' which records the hurricane prediction for each hurricane, before the hurricane actually lands. However, weather prediction related information doesn't appear in the complete dataset. Does that mean there is no weather prediction in the complete datasets for Phase I or Phase III? In what way, if any, should we interpret table TA2A-TA1C-0042Prediction.tsv given in Phase I?

Weather predictions do not appear in this dataset, but that does not mean that weather patterns may not be accessible.
