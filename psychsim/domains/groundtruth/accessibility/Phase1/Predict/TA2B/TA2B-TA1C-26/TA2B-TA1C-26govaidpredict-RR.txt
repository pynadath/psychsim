# Specific question #
For all the areas in the predict IDP, we would like to request records of government aid related to hurricanes over time, by hurricane. This is the predict phase analogue of explain phase requests 13-govtexpenses-firstarea and 14-govtexpenses-secondarea. Our original request for government aid had the following wording:


“For the second area, we would like to request records of government expenditures related to hurricanes over time, by hurricane. We would like the total amount spent and the category of expenditure (shelters; roads; rebuilding; monetary assistance to hurricane victims).”
