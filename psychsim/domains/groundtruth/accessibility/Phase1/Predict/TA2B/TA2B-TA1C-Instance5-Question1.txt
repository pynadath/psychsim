**Specific Question**:

The ActorPostTable.tsv for Instance 5 is unique in that its column names involve all hurricanes (e.g. “At Shelter All Hurricanes”, “Dissatisfaction All Hurricanes”, “Evacuated All Hurricanes”, “Injured All Hurricanes”, and “Risk All Hurricanes”). By contrast, the columns in all the other Instances in the Predict-IDP refer to the “Previous Hurricane”. Do Instance 5 column names refer to the previous hurricane or all hurricanes? 

**Other applicable detail**:
None

**Answer**:

They refer to all hurricanes, as the table for that instance was mistakenly generated using the old Explain IDP instrument. We have provided an updated table that uses the same instrument as the other Predict instances.
