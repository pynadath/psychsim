We interpreted the survey items literally, implementing them as as "Did you share X with your peers during the previous hurricane?". We sampled residents at the current world time (i.e., the last day of the IDP). We asked them to also provide the ActorPostTable info regarding whether they were evacuated or at the shelter at any point during the previous hurricane.
