# Specific question #


We would like to collect demographics (Age, Children, Ethnicity, Fulltime_Job, Gender, Pets    Religion, Residence) of friends for each person who responded to RR 38myfriends. Previous requests have determined that friends refuse to be identified specifically, but we are hoping that friends will be willing to provide their demographics, e.g. a friend could be identified anonymously but the data could include “friend1 Age 35 Children 0 Ethnicity majority…” etc.


# Sampling strategy #
We request these questions be collected for all of the Participant IDs who responded to RR 38myfriends and to match those Participant IDs
