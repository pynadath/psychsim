We would like to collect detailed information for the for the three Target Actors whose behavior we are asked to predict (Instance 3: 82, Instance 4: 122, Instance 5: 152). Specifically, we would like to request the following to be asked of these three Target Actors:


Q1. For the hurricane previous to the hurricane we are asked to predict for, we would like to request Participant ID, Timestep, Number of Friends, Number of Friends Evacuated, Number of Friends Sheltered, Days Missed Work, Days Worked. (We have some partial data already for this but not for all actors.)


Q2. A pre-survey deployed for the upcoming hurricane we are asked to predict, i.e. Participant ID, Timstep, At_Shelter, Evacuated, and Severity. 


Q3. A shelter and evacuation journal on all previous hurricanes using the same questions as requested previously in RR21shelterandevac and RR33explainshelterevacjournal:
i. EverUsedShelter: Did you stay at a public shelter at any point during any previous hurricane this season?
ii. WhichHurricanesSheltered: Which previous hurricanes this season caused you to go to a shelter?
iii. EverEvacuated: Did you stay at a public shelter at any point during any previous hurricane this season?
iv. WhichHurricanesEvacd: Which previous hurricanes this season caused you to evacuate your home?

vi. DaysSpentInShelter: For the past hurricanes where you sought shelter, how many days did you spend at the shelter before moving on? Please list the number of days spent in the shelter for all hurricanes where you sheltered.
vii. DaysSpentInEvacd: For the past hurricanes where you evacuated, how many days did you spend evacuated before either returning home or going to a shelter? Please list the number of days spent evacuated for all hurricanes where you evacuated.
