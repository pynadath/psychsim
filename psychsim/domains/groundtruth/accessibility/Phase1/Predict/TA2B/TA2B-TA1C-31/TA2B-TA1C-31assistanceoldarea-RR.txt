# Specific question #
We would like to request the Assistance_Previous_Hurricane survey variable for the post-hurricane survey for the original area. This survey question has been collected previously, such as in RR9newarea (area 2) and RR30assistance (areas 3-8), but not for the original area (area 1). We ask that the respondents to the post-hurricane survey be asked the following question regarding government assistance. 


Q1. Assistance: I received government assistance during or after this past hurricane in response to that hurricane. 
(Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)


Q2. AssistanceToEvac: I have received government assistance during or after this past hurricane in order to enable or encourage me or my household to evacuate. 
(Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)


Q3. AssistanceToShelter: I have received government assistance during or after this past hurricane in order to enable or encourage me or my household to use a shelter. 
(Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)


Q4. EverAssistanceToEvac: I have received government assistance at some point in the past in order to enable or encourage me or my household to evacuate in response to a hurricane. 
(Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)


Q5. EverAssistanceToShelter: I have received government assistance at some point in the past in order to enable or encourage me or my household to use a shelter in response to a hurricane. 
(Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)




# Sampling strategy #
We request this assistance question to be collected for all of the Participant IDs in the original area explain phase paired-approach collections and with respect to the days of their responses to the post-hurricane surveys. We expect the participant IDs of respondents to match the ones collected previously in the original area in RR10currentareamoretime in the corresponding actor post-hurricane surveys.
