# Sampling strategy #
Please sample 10% in every area (Areas 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8), providing the unique identifiers for each participant. Deploy this survey at the end of the latest season of hurricanes. 


# Other applicable detail #
We would like to survey individuals to learn about the attributes of their friends without asking them to name specific friends. This will help us to assess what ways friendships affect behaviors and decision making in these populations.
