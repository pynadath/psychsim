# Research method category #
Survey


# Specific question #


We would like the data in RR 31assistanceoldarea to be augmented with either ids that match the Post Actor Survey in the first simulation instance or include demographic variables (Age Children Ethnicity Fulltime_Job Gender Pets Religion Residence).


# Sampling strategy #
We request this information of all the respondents to RR31. (The original sampling strategy was to “request the assistance question to be collected for all of the Participant IDs in the original area explain phase paired-approach collections and with respect to the days of their responses to the post-hurricane surveys. We expect the participant IDs of respondents to match the ones collected previously in the original area in RR10currentareamoretime in the corresponding actor post-hurricane surveys.”)
