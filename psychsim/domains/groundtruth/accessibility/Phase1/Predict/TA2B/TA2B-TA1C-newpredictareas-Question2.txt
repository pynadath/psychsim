# Specific question #

Since we are studying the populations of 6 new areas during the Predict challenge, we seek to understand the contextual information regarding how these populations may differ from the first population studied during the Explain challenge. 
(This is a second set of questions. newpredictareas-Question1 contained the first set.)

Q2. Which of the following aspects of the new populations or environments of each area can have changed between the explain and predict datasets? (mark all that apply):

___ a. the number or quality of hospitals differ between areas
___ b. the overall type of terrain (e.g. mountainous vs. flat) differs between the areas
___ c. the percentage of home ownership differs between the areas
___ d. the man-made structures such as houses differ in quality or building materials between the areas
___ e. the overall rate of having medical conditions and/or being disabled differs between the areas, even controlling for age and injury status
___ f. the crime rate differs between the areas [internal note: this is relevant for looting behavior, which is possible impact of a hurricane]
___ g. the accuracy of hurricane forecasts differs between the areas
___ h. the level of education and/or number or quality of schools or universities differs between the areas
___ i. the types of social ties and information shared with peers could differ between the areas

# Other applicable details #
Given that the predict IDP contains data on distinct population areas from the areas studied in the Explain challenge, we need to know the contextual correspondence between the explain and predict world in order to assess what conclusions or data from the explain test may be used during the predict test.

# Answer #

As per the FAQs provided to the TA2 teams, ground truth has not changed between the explain and predict challenges. Other questions should be answered through research.
