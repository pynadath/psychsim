# Specific question #
We would like to request the Assistance_Previous_Hurricane survey variable for the post-hurricane survey for the five areas in the predict IDP. The first survey question has been collected previously, such as in RR9newarea and RR2020propdamageinoldarea. We ask that the respondents to the post-hurricane survey be asked the following 6 questions regarding government assistance. 


Q1. Assistance: I received government assistance during or after this past hurricane in response to that hurricane. (Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)


Q2. The assistance I received was purely monetary. (Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)


Q3. I received assistance to make up for wages that I could not earn while in a sheltered or evacuated status. (Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)


Q4. I received assistance to offset my losses due to hurricane damage to my property (where property means things I own). (Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)


Q5. I received assistance to offset bills I needed to pay as a result of injury of myself or a family member. (Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)


Q6. I received assistance to offset bills I needed to pay as a result of death of a family member. (Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)


# Sampling strategy #
We request these assistance questions be collected for all of the Participant IDs in the five areas (Instances 3-8) of the predict IDP and with respect to the days of their responses to the post-hurricane surveys.
