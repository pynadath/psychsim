# Specific question #


1. For prediction questions 1 and 2 on both the Short-Term and Long-Term questions, should the numbers we report include the count of children or should the totals reflect only the adult counts? For example, when reporting on the number of people who evacuate at least once in a new hurricane, does this include children and adults, or adults only? Similarly for casualties, deaths, and (implicitly) the percentages thereof.


2. For the PopulationTable datasets released in all areas, do the number of deaths, casualties, evacuees, and sheltered people include children, or are they for adults only?


3. The datasets we have received thus far have indicated that households are comprised of one adult, who is the head of household, and some number (possibly zero) of children. Please confirm that households never contain other adults than the head of the household. 


# Other applicable details #
We know due to a previous research request (RR7children_survey) that adults can evacuate with their children. We wish to clarify the predict question as well as the interpretation of IDP datasets. 


# Answer #

1. Adults only.

2. Adults only.

3. That is correct.
