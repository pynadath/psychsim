# Specific question #
We would like to augment the actor post-hurricane survey for original two areas (areas 1-2) by asking each person various questions about their friends. The previous RR28socnet obtained demographics and the number of friends for the areas in the predict phase (areas 3-8) with a 10% sample at the end of each hurricane season. Two additional questions about whether their friends evacuated or sheltered for each hurricane were asked by a pending request for the actor-post survey for areas 3-8 with 32PairedPredictSurveys-RR. These three questions constitute the questions on the present survey on friends for the original areas (1-2). We would like to collect this information for all participant IDs in the actor post-survey in the original areas (areas 1-2).  


We expect the participant IDs to match the ones collected previously in the original two areas in RR9newarea and RR10currentareamoretime in their respective actor post-hurricane surveys. 


Questions:


Q1. Number of Friends: During the previous hurricane, how many friends did you have?
Q2. Number of Friends Evacuated: In the previous hurricane, how many of your friends evacuated?
Q3. Number of Friends Sheltered: In the previous hurricane, how many of your friends sheltered? 




# Sampling strategy #
We request these questions be collected for all of the Participant IDs in the original area and new area explain phase paired-approach collections and with respect to the days of their responses to the post-hurricane surveys. We expect the participant IDs of respondents to match the ones collected previously in the original area in RR10currentareamoretime in the new area RR9newarea, in the corresponding actor post-hurricane surveys.
