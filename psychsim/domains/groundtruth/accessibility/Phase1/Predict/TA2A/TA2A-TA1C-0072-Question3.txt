Specific question:Can we be sure that the data provided in TA2A-TA1C-0072-RR is indeed a continuing sequence of the Phase I world? More specifically, we want to know:	Some people report they are in evacuation at timestep 85, which is the beginning time of TA2A-TA1C-0072-RR data. We would like to know whether this time step 85 is 3 days after time 82 (ending date of the initial data, in that case this evacuation will be caused by hurricane 6 in the initial data package); Or, is this evacuation generated at the beginning of the new data, and may not relate to the initial data package?Other applicable detail:Answer
