Specific question:1. We don’t fully understand the ‘Deaths’ and ‘Casualties’ in the population table of Phase II (Predict phase) instance. Since the death is the cumulative number of people that are dead, and casualty is the current number of people dead or injured, if the ‘death’ value on one day is 3, is it true that ‘casualty’ should be always equal or more than 3 on this day? (Even if no one is requiring hospitalization, should we still count the 3 people which were dead long ago?).2. We have trouble interpreting the sentence in the Long-Term Prediction Challenge: ‘The period of interest for the following questions is the following hurricane season.’		What does ‘the following hurricane season’ mean? Is it the hurricane season right after the current hurricane season? It seems we have no information about the next hurricane season at all, can we ask for a prediction of all hurricane movement/category/time in the next hurricane season?Other applicable detail:Answer:1. Yes, the number of casualties in your example will be at least 3. The number of casualties on a given day includes the people who are currently injured or dead on that day, regardless of what day they suffered injury or death.2. Yes, the following hurricane season will be after the current one, although there will be a gap with no hurricanes between them. No information is available in advance regarding the next hurricane season.
