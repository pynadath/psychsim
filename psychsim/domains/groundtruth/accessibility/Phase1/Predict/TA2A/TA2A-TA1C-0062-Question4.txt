Specific question:In TA2A-TA1C-0062-RR, we were told that people will get the ‘regional damage’ report from social media. Can we know whether the regional damage from social media is the same thing as the regional damage provided by the government (and shown to us)? And since we already know that the regional damage from the government is not the exact number (which means if regional damage for two regions are both 2, it is still possible the exact regional damage values are different), can we know whether the regional damage value people get from social media is the approximate value(just like the one we get), or the exact number of certain damage?Other applicable detail:Answer:If you are referring to the regional damage information from "any public sources (media, government broadcast, TV, etc)", as specified in TA2A-TA1C-0062-RR, then yes, the participants are referring to the same approximate value reported by the government.
