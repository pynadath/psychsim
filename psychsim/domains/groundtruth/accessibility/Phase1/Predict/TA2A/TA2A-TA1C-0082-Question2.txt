Specific question:
1. In TA2A-TA1C-0082-RR, when people asked about the severity of hurricanes before they landed, almost all of them reported the severity to be 1 even if the hurricane category is 2. While in both TA2A-TA1C-0072-RR and the Initial Data Package, most of the people reported severity to be exactly the same as the current hurricane category. Odd as it is, we want to know:
a. Can we be sure that the severity reported in TA2A-TA1C-0082-RR is the same ‘severity’ reported in TA2A-TA1C-0072-RR and in the initial data package?
b. Is it possible that in our simulation in TA2A-TA1C-0082-RR, people still behave not exactly the same when they report severity, even if they claim that they have enough information they need to report severity level just as when they report severity in the world generated by TA1.
c. If not for both a) and b), what’s the difference between the the way to generate ‘severity’ in TA2A-TA1C-0072-RR and TA2A-TA1C-0082-RR (We are almost certain there must be some difference).

Answer:

1. We made a mistake: we interpreted "risk/severity" of the participant as focusing on the risk side, and missed the parenthetical elaboration that you wanted just "severity" before the hurricane made landfall. Therefore you can interpret the "Risk/Severity" column as just "Risk". As it happens, the participants' response to a "Severity" question before landfall would be identical to their response to the "Category to Friend", so the table still contains the values you requested. We apologize for the inconvenience.
