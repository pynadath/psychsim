Specific question:1. Is there an attribute similar to ‘topography’ that exists for each region?(e.g. Mountains in one region, Forests in another region)2. Is there any other demographic information existing in the simulation that we don’t know so far?(Like age, gender, etc.) If so, can we know what they are?3. In the worlds of Prediction Phase, since we already know people in those two phases are different (although they have the same behavior type)does people’s marital state exist in the simulation (e.g. Single, married, etc.)?4. We find a person living in Region02 and aged 24 reported wealth level to be 1 in TA2A-TA1C-0082-RR (at timestep 82), while it also reports wealth to be 4 in TA2A-TA1C-0032-RR (We are told it is also reported in timestep 82). Why is there such a huge difference between their answers? (Additionally, in TA2A-TA1C-0092-RR, this person states wealth to be 2, the third value we know so far. The same phenomenon appears a lot, e.g. person aged 34 at Region02 reports wealth to be 5 at timestep 82 in TA2A-TA1C-0092-RR, but 0 in TA2A-TA1C-0032-RR).Other applicable detail:Answer:1. No2. No3. No4. The "Wealth" in TA2A-TA1C-0032-RR was taken from the census, so it represents the actors' wealth at timestep 1. The "Wealth" in TA2A-TA1C-0082-RR is a survey question, answered at timestep 82. The "Wealth" in TA2A-TA1C-0092-RR is also taken from the census, but the scale has been changed for the Predict challenge to ensure a 1-5 response (the earlier scale allowed for a response of 0 as well).
