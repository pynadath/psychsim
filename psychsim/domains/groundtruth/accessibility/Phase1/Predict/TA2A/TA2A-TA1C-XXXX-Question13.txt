Specific question:1. If we want to ask survey questions to people in each world of Phase II/ Predict Phase(6 instances in total), how many people we can survey in each instance in one RR?2. Is it possible that we request another ‘census’ to people in 6 instances, where we only ask people in certain regions to fill in their demographic information and don’t ask them questions at all, in that case, how much information can we collect? (Or is there a database within the government which registers the population’s demographic information that we can get access to?)Other applicable detail:Answer:1. 10%2. Yes, you can get government-supplied demographic information on all of the residents of any region.
