Specific question:     We want to know the definition of evacuate/injury during hurricane X.	Assume we have a hurricane table looks that like this(category and region are ignored):	Time  Name  Land       1     1    no       2     1    yes       3     1    yes       4     1    leaving       5        6       7     2    no       …   Hurricane 1 forms at T1, lands at T2, leaves at T4, and the next hurricane forms at T7. If someone claims that they evacuate during hurricane 1, please list all possible days they may evacuate by knowing “it evacuates at hurricane 1” in our example (e.g. T1, T2, T3, T4)   Also, is there is a time doesn’t fall into the period of either hurricane 1 and hurricane 2(e.g. Maybe T5 or T6), and someone gets injured on that day, what will the report state in our survey?Other applicable detail:Answer:For the purposes of the post-hurricane survey, hurricane 1 would span Timesteps 2-4 (inclusive). Timesteps 1 and 7 would be covered by the pre-hurricane survey. Timesteps 5 and 6 would not be considered part of either hurricane.
