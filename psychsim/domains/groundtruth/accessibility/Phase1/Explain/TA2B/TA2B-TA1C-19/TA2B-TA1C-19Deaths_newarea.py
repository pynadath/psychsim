**Research method category**: Government Data


**Specific question**:
We would like to collect government data about the demographics, location, and evacuation / sheltered status of individuals who have died as a result of the hurricane, broken down by hurricane, for the new area (we did not receive data on deaths in the original area). Such data might be available via coronersâ€™ or police reports, obituaries, death certificates, etc, but notionally might be identical across all these sources. 


**Other applicable detail**: Please provide whichever sources of relevant data on this that is available. 


**Research request identifier**: 19Deaths_newarea
