**Specific question**:
We would like to clarify if a particular compromise between longitudinal and broad collection can be performed. Specifically we would like to instrument the new area as well as the current area (moving forward in time) in the following way. Post-hurricane surveys are still collected on the largest random sample of the population possible (which we gather to be either 10 or 20 percent). However, respondents are revisited for the following hurricane. That is, after hurricane 1 we try to resample the same respondents for hurricane 2, if some of those respondents decline to respond for hurricane 2, we look for new respondents until we reach our percent of the population target. After we have two _consecutive_ post-hurricane surveys from the same household, we move on to other potential respondents in the population, in each case trying to create a pairing of a post-hurricane response in hurricane N and N+1. 


1. If we ask for more data from the existing area as time moves forward, approximately how many additional hurricanes worth of data would be available?


2. Would asking for more data from the existing area change our ability to collect data from the other area? That is, would we need to instrument the other hurricane affected area before asking for another hurricane season’s worth of data?


3. Could we ask for two hurricane seasons’ worth of data from the new area at once?


4. Would the above strategy of creating (N, N+1) pairs be possible in the existing area as time advances? What percentage of the population would we be limited to after each hurricane? Would we be able to sample different respondents to get more population coverage after a household has answered two consecutive questionnaires? 


5. Would the above strategy of creating (N, N+1) pairs be possible in the new area from the beginning of the time period? What percentage of the population would we be limited to?


6. Would the above strategy be available for pre-hurricane surveys as well in the existing area as time advances? What percentage of the population would we be limited to?


7. Would the above strategy be available for pre-hurricane surveys as well in the new area from the beginning of the time period? What percentage of the population would we be limited to?




**Other applicable detail**: The reason we are requesting this unusual dataset is that we are interested in first-order Markov dependencies between agent decisions for hurricane N, and hurricane N+1. However, we still need broader coverage of the population than a strict 10 percent sample and purely longitudinal survey would allow. 




**Answer**:

1. If no timespan is specified, we would provide data for the remainder of the current hurricane season. But other timespans are possible if requested.

2. No.

3. Yes.

4. Yes. 10%. Yes.

5. Yes. 10%.

6. Yes. 10%.

7. Yes. 10%.
