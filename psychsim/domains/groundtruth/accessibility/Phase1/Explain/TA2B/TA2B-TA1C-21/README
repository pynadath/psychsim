The participants consider only those days on which there is a hurricane (i.e., days listed in HurricaneTable).

For items asking for responses across potentially multiple hurricanes, we put the values into a comma-separated list, ordered chronologically (i.e., in the same order as the hurricanes are listed in the corresponding question). 

The dissatisfaction ratings are based on feelings on the last day of each hurricane.

For questions about sheltering (evacuation) to participants who did not shelter (evacuate), their response is 'N/A'.
