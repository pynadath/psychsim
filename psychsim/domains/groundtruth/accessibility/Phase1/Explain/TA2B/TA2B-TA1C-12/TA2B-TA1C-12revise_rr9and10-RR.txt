**Research method category**: Survey revision


**Specific question**:


We’d like to ask for a second version of data for RR9 and RR10 where the same respondents report their responses to i. At Shelter and ii. Evacuated as described below:


d. Survey questions:
i. At shelter: Did you move to stay at a public shelter at any point during the previous
hurricane as a result of the previous hurricane? (Which should be interpreted as going to the shelter due to this past hurricane. If the person was already in the shelter due to a hurricane prior to the previous hurricane, then the person should only answer yes if they would have gone to the shelter because of this past hurricane as well, and should answer no if they would not have gone to the shelter and were simply on their way out of the shelter when the next hurricane hit. If the respondent was already in sheltered state and cannot answer what they would have done, then use the response: AlreadySheltered. So the 3 choices in that case would be Yes, No, and AlreadySheltered.
ii. Evacuated: Did you evacuate the area at any point during the previous hurricane as a result of the previous hurricane? (Which should be interpreted as evacuating due to this past hurricane. If the person was already evacuated due to a hurricane prior to the last hurricane, then the person should only answer yes if they would have evacuated because of this past hurricane as well, and should answer no if they would not have evacuated and were simply on their way back but not yet arrived when the next hurricane hit. If the respondent was already in an evacuated state and cannot answer what they would have done, then use the response: AlreadyEvacuated. So the 3 choices in that case would be Yes, No, and AlreadyEvacuated) 




**Sampling strategy**: We’d like the updated responses from the people in RR9 and RR10. 


**Other applicable detail**: This is a revision request for RR9 and RR10 submitted in response to the the IDPrevise CQ:
“Clarification[a]: Previous survey responses have all interpreted the evacuation and shelter questions as to whether the actor was out of the area or at the shelter during the previous hurricane, whereas the question here asks about whether actor *moved* out of the area or to the shelter during the previous hurricane. If there was any confusion on this point, we can re-generate the prior tables (i.e., for requests 9 and 10) with the specific interpretation given in (i) and (ii) above, to be consistent with the re-generated IDP. These would be in addition to (not instead of) the original survey items already answered.”
