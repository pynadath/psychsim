Specific question:

Thank you for the shelter data. The capacity of the single shelter is listed as 160. We have noticed there are 277 people in this area with 160 of those being adults. Is the capacity listed the number of adults that the shelter can hold or the number of people (both adults and children)?

Other applicable detail:
None


Answer:

The capacity is the number of families that can be in the shelter at any one time.
