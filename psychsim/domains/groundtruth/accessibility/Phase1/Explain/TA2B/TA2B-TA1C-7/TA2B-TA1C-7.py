Research method category: Survey

Specific questions to be answered by the sampled households:
This survey is meant to be deployed to households. A single custodial adult should respond to the questions for the household. 

0. Ask the post hurricane demographics questions (age, children, ethnicity, fulltime job, gender, pets, region, religion)
For each hurricane "N" :
1. How many children do you have? (integer 0+; if 0, no need to answer questions 2-4)
2. If you evacuated for hurricane N, did you bring all of your children with you? (Yes / No / Did not evacuate)
3. If you went to a shelter for hurricane N, did you bring all of your children with you? (Yes / No / Did not go to shelter)
4. How many of your children suffered from casualties in hurricane N? (integer 0+)

Sampling strategy:
50% random sample of all households.

Other applicable detail:
Hypothesis: Our general hypothesis about this scenario right now is: The decision to evacuate is a cost benefit calculation conducted by the individual household. Benefits are reduced risk of injury. Costs are lost wages, logistical cost, lost property, and inability to shelter/transport pets. We hypothesize that families with children bear more logistical costs and are more risk averse to lost wages as well as injury. Sheltering is an alternate option to evacuation that has lower logistical cost. However, inadequate capacity or distance may be limiting the use of shelters. The outcome of interest is: casualties. This research request helps us test the part of the hypothesis related to children.
