**Specific Question**:
 
Thank you for the children survey data. We have encountered some puzzling 
observations in the data set. Specifically, we think the evacuation data for 
hurricane 4 may not agree with the data given in the initial data package. 
9 families with children were surveyed on whether they evacuated and none of 
them reported evacuating. We know that at least 64 of the 160 families 
evacuated for hurricane 4 from the initial data package. It seems unlikely 
that a random sample would not include anyone evacuating. Also, 5 families 
evacuated for hurricane 3 and hurricane 5 in this sample, which is in line 
with what we would expect given the population statistics. Could you check 
the data in this data package and send any needed clarifications?

**Other applicable detail**:
None

**Answer**:

The wording of the survey items in the challenge description was imprecise. The survey questions for the post-hurricane survey (5.d.i-v) should say "previous hurricanes", not just "previous hurricane".
