**Specific Question**:

We have identified a specific inconsistency between TA2B-TA1C-7children_survey and the rest of the data package. Furthermore, the data in TA2B-TA1C-7children_survey regarding hurricane 4 is very unlikely given the rest of the data package. Please verify the consistency of the TA2B-TA1C-7children_survey with the prior data.


In CensusTable.tsv, there is a single 18-24 year old in Region03. In TA2B-TA1C-1_Motivation_Survey, participant 12 is 23 years old and lives in Region03. She evacuated for hurricane 4 in that survey. In TA2B-TA1C-7children_survey, participant 14 is 23 years old and lives in Region03. She did not evacuate for hurricane 4 in that survey. We believe these are the same person and are asking that you resolve the discrepancy in the data.


In the TA2B-TA1C-7children_survey sample of 16 people, 9 had children and responded to the survey. None of the people with children reported evacuating. Given the data in PopulationTable.tsv, the probability that a uniform random sample would have 9 people who did not evacuate for hurricane 4 is ~1%. In contrast, the evacuation rates for Hurricane 3 and 5 in TA2B-TA1C-7children_survey are more consistent with PopulationTable.tsv. Given the apparent discrepancy in the individual data above and the statistical rareness of this data, we think it is likely the hurricane 4 data in TA2B-TA1C-7children_survey is not correct.  

**Other applicable detail**:
None

**Answer**:

For the survey for request 1, participants responded in the positive to evacuation questions if they were outside the area at any point during the given hurricane. As a result, if a person evacuated during hurricane N and didn't return until after hurricane N+1, then s/he would respond in the positive for both hurricanes N and N+1. For the survey for request 7, participants responded in the positive to evacuation questions only if their evacuation occurred during the given hurricane. So in the previous example, the participant would respond in the positive for hurricane N, but not for hurricane N+1.
