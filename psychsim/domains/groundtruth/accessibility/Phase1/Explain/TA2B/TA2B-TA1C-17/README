We randomly sampled eight participants, as it is not plausible to be able to force specific individuals into keeping such a journal. Each participant's journal is in a separate file, although they can be merged, as their unique ID is included in each entry. 

The journals span the two seasons covered by the IDP and TA2B-TA1C-10currentareamoretime, i.e., we retroactively asked the participants to keep the event journals from day 1.
The actors record their current location in every entry, which should account for items 3, 7a, and 7b.

The hurricane information is available in the HurricaneTable.

6a seems to be a duplicate of 4.
