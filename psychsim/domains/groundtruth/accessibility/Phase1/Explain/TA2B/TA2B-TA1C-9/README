The tables and fields are as requested, with the following clarifications or deviations:

1. PopulationTable: 
c. Evacuated: number of households who have left the area completely and have not returned
by the given day
d. Sheltered: number of households at a public shelter on the given day


2. RegionalTable:
c. Sheltered: number of regionâ€™s households at a public shelter on the given day.


5. ActorPostTable:
d. Survey questions: We included the items from the original post-hurricane survey, which referred to all previous hurricanes included in the data package. We distinguish the coverage of potentially ambiguous survey items by labeling them either "<Item> Previous Hurricane" or "<Item> All Hurricanes". We also labeled the items not contained in the initial version of the survey ("Assistance", "Injury Children", and "Property") with "Previous Hurricane", again to avoid any ambiguity.
