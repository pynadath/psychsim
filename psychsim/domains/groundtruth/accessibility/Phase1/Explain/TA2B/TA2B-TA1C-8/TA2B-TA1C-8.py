With regard to the decision to evacuate or seek shelter, do you agree or disagree with the following (please respond on a 0-5 scale, 0 is Strongly Disagree, 5 is Strongly Agree. If the question does not apply to you, e.g. if you do not have any pets, please answer NA):
1. I had access to transportation to evacuate.
2. I had access to transportation to a shelter.
3. My pet(s) would be accommodated at a shelter.
4. My pets(s) could accompany me if I evacuated.
5. I am aware of a shelter available in my region.
6. I did not have enough money to afford to evacuate.
7. My family would be safer at home than at a shelter.
8. Shelters in my area are too crowded to shelter everyone who needs it.

Sampling strategy:
50% random sample of all households in the area.

Other applicable detail:
Hypothesis: Our general hypothesis about this scenario right now is: The decision to evacuate is a cost benefit calculation conducted by the individual household. Benefits are reduced risk of injury. Costs are lost wages, logistical cost, lost property, and inability to shelter/transport pets. We hypothesize that families with children bear more logistical costs and are more risk averse to lost wages as well as injury. Sheltering is an alternate option to evacuation that has lower logistical cost. However, inadequate capacity or distance may be limiting the use of shelters. The outcome of interest is: casualties. This research request helps us test the part of the hypothesis related to pets, financial costs of evacuation, and perceived shelter availability.
