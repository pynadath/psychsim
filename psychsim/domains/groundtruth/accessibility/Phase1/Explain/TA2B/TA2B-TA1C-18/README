This research request is really a question, as it pertains to how participants are answering the surveys, which is not something an expert in this world would be able to definitively answer.

1. The participants respond based on their perception of their wealth, so we cannot directly say what informs that perception.

2. The simulation does not distinguish between renting and owning.

3. Yes, the survey item asked about damage to only the participant's property.
