**Specific question**:
We would like an expert on this area to comment on the lack of measurable relationship between loss of wealth and property damage. Request 17evacjournalorigarea revealed several individuals, who reported property damage but no change in wealth. This led to some questions about how concepts such as property and wealth are defined in this world.


1. Is a household’s wealth defined as the collection of all assets including currency, material goods, and real estate structures and holdings? Alternately, is wealth considered to be just the accumulated earned income of a household less the direct living expenses?


2. Do citizens of this world typically own their own homes or rent, or is there a mixture of these two arrangements?


3. When a respondent reports suffering property damage, are they exclusively reporting on their own household’s belongings and structures?


**Other applicable detail**: None
