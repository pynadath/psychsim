**Specific Question**:

In response to previous research requests, you provided survey data (in 9newarea) with an “Assistance” variable relating to government assistance to an individual. Is this variable equivalent to the the “Aid” variable given to regions from the government expenses datasets (13govtexpenses-firstarea and 14govtexpenses-secondarea)? If yes, is there a way to translate the numerical value of “Assistance” into the uniform value of “Aid”? If these variables do not have identical interpretations, can you please give us a definition of what each variable means and/or how individual “Assistance” differs from regional “Aid”? For example, is the Aid to a region given solely to individuals residing in that region?

**Other applicable detail**:
None

**Answer**:

The variables are not necessarily equivalent. "Aid" pertains to the target of government assistance; "Assistance" pertains to the degree to which individuals feel they benefited from government assistance.
