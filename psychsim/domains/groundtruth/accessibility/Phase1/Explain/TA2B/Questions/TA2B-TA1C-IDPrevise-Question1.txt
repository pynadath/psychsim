**Specific question**:
After evaluating alternatives, we’ve concluded that due to limitation in the number of responses we can collect, it would be prohibitive for us to recollect the post-hurricane surveys from the IDP. At the same time, the questions being posed as in "the current hurricane season so far" have much less precise information than the original wording of “in the previous hurricane”. 


We’d like to know if we can request a re-issuing of the IDP package where the same respondents answer questions only about the previous hurricane in their post-hurricane survey. That is to say, could the IDP set be revised such that questions d are now:
d. Survey questions:


i. At shelter: Did you stay at a public shelter at any point during the previous
hurricane as a result of the previous hurricane? (Which should be interpreted as going to the shelter due to this past hurricane. If the person was already in the shelter due to a hurricane prior to the last hurricane, then the person should only answer yes if they would have gone to the shelter because of this past hurricane as well, and should answer no if they would not have gone to the shelter and were simply on their way out of the shelter when the next hurricane hit. If the respondent was already in sheltered state and cannot answer what they would have done, then use the response: AlreadySheltered. So the 3 choices in that case would be Yes, No, and AlreadySheltered) 


ii. Evacuated: Did you evacuate the area at any point during the previous hurricane as a result of the previous hurricane? (Which should be interpreted as evacuating due to this past hurricane. If the person was already evacuated due to a hurricane prior to the last hurricane, then the person should only answer yes if they would have evacuated because of this past hurricane as well, and should answer no if they would not have evacuated and were simply on their way back but not yet arrived when the next hurricane hit. If the respondent was already in an evacuated state and cannot answer what they would have done, then use the response: AlreadyEvacuated. So the 3 choices in that case would be Yes, No, and AlreadyEvacuated) 


iii. Injured: Did you suffer any injuries during the previous hurricane (do not count injuries that were due to hurricanes prior to the previous one)?


iv. Risk: The previous hurricane posed a significant risk to myself and my family. (Refer only to the most recent past hurricane)
(Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)


v. Dissatisfaction: The government response was unfair and inadequate. (Refer only to the most recent past hurricane) (Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)


**Other applicable detail**: None


**Answer**:

Given that the original wording of the survey items was incorrect, we will re-generate the ActorPostTable from the IDP to include both the original and the revised questions posed above. Please submit a research request with the above items.

Clarification: Previous survey responses have all interpreted the evacuation and shelter questions as to whether the actor was out of the area or at the shelter during the previous hurricane, whereas the question here asks about whether actor *moved* out of the area or to the shelter during the previous hurricane. If there was any confusion on this point, we can re-generate the prior tables (i.e., for requests 9 and 10) with the specific interpretation given in (i) and (ii) above, to be consistent with the re-generated IDP. These would be in addition to (not instead of) the original survey items already answered.
