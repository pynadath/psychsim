**Specific Question**:

In the Challenge Description.pdf for the initial data package, the 
Post-Hurricane Survey question d.v. is worded:
"v. Dissatisfaction: The government response was fair and adequate. (Response on a
1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)"

Is it correct that the data you gave us actually corresponds to the question:
"v. Dissatisfaction: The government response was *not* fair and adequate. (Response on a
1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)"

Please confirm if the second version of the wording above was the version respondents 
to the post-hurricane survey answered. 

**Other applicable detail**:

**Answer**:

Yes, the second version and the label "Dissatisfaction" are correct. This correction was meant to be included in an earlier response, so we apologize for the omission.
