Clarification questions from TA2B to TA1C, 10/23/2018 5pm

We would like to request clarification on the participants in both the pre- and 
post- hurricane surveys. We are requesting the unique participant IDs for each 
of the participants. Typically, each person surveyed is assigned a unique participant 
ID in a real survey so that researchers know who is surveyed and can track whether 
they have been surveyed more than once.
