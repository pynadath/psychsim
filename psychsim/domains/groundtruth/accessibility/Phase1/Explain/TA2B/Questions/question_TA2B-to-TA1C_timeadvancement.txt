Clarification question from TA2B to TA1C, 10/18/2018

Thank you for that information on the philosophy of timing with the simulations. 
The original question had more to do with how time in the simulation 
relates to time (and data requests) in our real world.

We wish to clarify:
How does time in the simulation relate to time on earth? That is, after 
a day passes on earth, does this change the information that is available 
to us in the simulation? Does actions on our part trigger the advancement of 
time in the simulation? Is it possible to say, deploy X research technique at 
the time in which the challenge started (Oct 15th our time). Can we go back 
and request to do a survey on that start date? If not, what are the 
restrictions for how time advances in relation to real-time?

Do potential observations lose availability over time; i.e., can we 
request data pertaining to any time period in the past or present at any time?

Do you potentially provide any interfaces for continual or intermittent 
interaction with your simulation?
