**Specific Question**:

In response to our clarification question TA2B-TA1C-7children_survey-Question-1.txt, you answered:


The wording of the survey items in the challenge description was imprecise. The survey questions for the post-hurricane survey (5.d.i-v) should say "previous hurricanes", not just "previous hurricane".


We are confused by this answer. If we replace “previous hurricane” with “previous hurricanes” in those survey questions, they would read as:


Survey questions:
i. At shelter: Did you stay at a public shelter at any point during the previous hurricanes?
ii. Evacuated: Did you evacuate the area at any point during the previous hurricanes?
iii. Injured: Did you suffer any injuries during the previous hurricanes?
iv. Risk: The previous hurricanes posed a significant risk to myself and my family.
v. Dissatisfaction: The government response was fair and adequate.


Please clarify if the original questions or the new modified questions are the correct ones. If the modified questions are the correct ones, we ask that you provide more detail on how to interpret them. For example, if one of the previous N hurricanes posed a risk to a respondent's family and N-1 did not, how would a respondent answer? Or if the government’s response was adequate for some of the previous hurricanes and inadequate for others, how would that factor into the respondent’s answer?

**Other applicable detail**:
None

**Answer**:

Apologies for the confusion. The survey respondents interpret "the previous hurricanes" as "the current hurricane season so far" (the initial data package is all within the current hurricane season). The respondents answer as they deem appropriate.
