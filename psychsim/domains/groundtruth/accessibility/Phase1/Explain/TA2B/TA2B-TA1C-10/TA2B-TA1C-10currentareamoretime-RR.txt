**Research method category**: Survey, Observational Data


**Specific question**:
We would like to collect observational data and survey data on the current population for the remainder of the current hurricane season and the entirety of the upcoming hurricane season. 


Observational Data:


1. PopulationTable: These are statistics aggregated over the entire urban area, broken down by
“Timstep”.
a. Deaths: cumulative number of deaths as of the given day
b. Casualties: current number of residents who are either injured (requiring hospitalization)
or dead on the given day
c. Evacuated: number of residents who have left the area completely and have not returned
by the given day
d. Sheltered: number of residents at a public shelter on the given day


2. RegionalTable: These are statistics for each day broken down by each region and day
(“Timestep”).
a. Deaths: cumulative number of region’s residents who have died this season as of the
given day
b. Casualties: number of region’s residents who are either injured (requiring hospitalization)
or dead on the given day
c. Sheltered: number of region’s residents at a public shelter on the given day.


3. HurricaneTable: Entries made for only those days (i.e., “Timestep”) when a hurricane is present:
a. Hurricane: Identifying number of hurricane (first hurricane of the first season is 1, if the last hurricane of the first season is N then the first hurricane of the second season is N+1).
b. Category: The category of the current hurricane (1-5 scale, with 5 being the most severe)
c. Location: The region where the hurricane is projected to make landfall (if it has not yet
landed) or where it is currently centered (if it has). If the hurricane has moved out of the
area, the location will be given as “leaving”.
d. Landed: Whether or not (“yes” or “no”) this hurricane has made landfall.


Survey Data: We expect the firm conducting the pre- and post- hurricane surveys to use a consistent set of linked participant ID’s. We want the recruitment for these surveys to follow the pairing approach described in Sampling Strategy. 


4. ActorPreTable: Actor-level survey, conducted when a hurricane is approaching:
a. Participant: ID for participant.
b. Hurricane: Identifying number of hurricane (see numbering notes in HurricaneTable).
c. Demographics: gender, age, ethnicity (either majority or minority), religion (either
majority, minority, or none), number of children, wealth (on a 0-5 scale, increasing
from 0 to 5), pet owned or not, fulltime job or not, region of residence
d. Survey questions:
i. At Shelter: Are you currently staying at a public shelter?
ii. Evacuated: Are you currently residing outside the area?
iii. Severity: The approaching hurricane poses a significant risk to the area.
(Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)
iv. LastSheltered: When did you last stay in the public shelter at any point in response to the previous hurricane (we are asking for the date you left for the shelter)?
v. LastEvacuated: When did you last evacuate in response to a hurricane (where evacuate is defined as leaving the area to reside elsewhere as a result of the hurricane and we are asking for the date you left)?


5. ActorPostTable: Actor-level survey, conducted after a hurricane has passed:
a. Participant: ID for participant.
b. Hurricane: Identifying number of hurricane (see numbering notes in HurricaneTable).
c. Demographics: gender, age, ethnicity (either majority or minority), religion (either
majority, minority, or none), number of children, wealth (on a 0-5 scale, increasing
from 0 to 5), pet owned or not, fulltime job or not, region of residence
d. Survey questions:
i. At shelter: Did you stay at a public shelter at any point during the previous
hurricane?
ii. Evacuated: Did you evacuate the area at any point during the previous hurricane?
iii. Injured: Did you suffer any injuries during the previous hurricane?
iv. Risk: The previous hurricane posed a significant risk to myself and my family.
(Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)
v. Dissatisfaction: The government response was fair and adequate. (Response on a
1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)


**Sampling strategy**: For each of the surveys conducted either before or after a hurricane, sample 10% of the total population. Use an approach where respondents are revisited for the following hurricane. For example in the post-hurricane surveys, after hurricane 1 we first try to resample the same respondents for hurricane 2, if some of those respondents decline to respond for hurricane 2, we look for new respondents until we reach our percent of the population target. After we have two _consecutive_ post-hurricane surveys from the same household, we move on to the not yet surveyed potential respondents in the population, in each case trying to create a pairing of a post-hurricane response in hurricane N and N+1. Once all households that are willing to be surveyed have filled 2 consecutive surveys, start over with a fully random sample.
