**Research method category**: Survey revision


**Specific question**:


We’d like to ask for a revision of the IDP package where the same respondents answer questions only about the previous hurricane in their post-hurricane survey. That is to say, could the IDP set be revised such that questions d are now:


d. Survey questions:
i. At shelter: Did you move to stay at a public shelter at any point during the previous
hurricane as a result of the previous hurricane? (Which should be interpreted as going to the shelter due to this past hurricane. If the person was already in the shelter due to a hurricane prior to the previous hurricane, then the person should only answer yes if they would have gone to the shelter because of this past hurricane as well, and should answer no if they would not have gone to the shelter and were simply on their way out of the shelter when the next hurricane hit. If the respondent was already in sheltered state and cannot answer what they would have done, then use the response: AlreadySheltered. So the 3 choices in that case would be Yes, No, and AlreadySheltered)
ii. Evacuated: Did you evacuate the area at any point during the previous hurricane as a result of the previous hurricane? (Which should be interpreted as evacuating due to this past hurricane. If the person was already evacuated due to a hurricane prior to the last hurricane, then the person should only answer yes if they would have evacuated because of this past hurricane as well, and should answer no if they would not have evacuated and were simply on their way back but not yet arrived when the next hurricane hit. If the respondent was already in an evacuated state and cannot answer what they would have done, then use the response: AlreadyEvacuated. So the 3 choices in that case would be Yes, No, and AlreadyEvacuated)
iii. Injured: Did you suffer any injuries during the previous hurricane (do not count injuries that were due to hurricanes prior to the previous one)?
iv. Risk: The previous hurricane posed a significant risk to myself and my family. (Refer only to the most recent hurricane)
(Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)
v. Dissatisfaction: The government response was unfair and inadequate. (Refer only to the most recent hurricane) (Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)


**Sampling strategy**: We’d like the responses to be updated from the people of the initial data package (IDP) post-hurricane surveys. 


**Other applicable detail**: This is a revision request to the set of surveys included in the IDP to clarify the meaning of evacuated and sheltered so that responses are more usable to us for causal analysis.
