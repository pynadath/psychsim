**Research method category**: Survey


**Specific question**:
We would like to request a post-hurricane survey for the original area that fills out the variables present in the new area Post Survey: Property Damage. For convenience we have included the survey of the area. Either this survey can be re-deployed on the old and new seasons for the original area, or simply the question pertaining to property damage could be asked to the original area post-hurricane survey respondents. 


5. ActorPostTable: Actor-level survey, conducted after a hurricane has passed:
a. Participant: ID for participant.
b. Hurricane: Identifying number of hurricane (see numbering notes in HurricaneTable).
c. Demographics: gender, age, ethnicity (either majority or minority), religion (either
majority, minority, or none), number of children, wealth (on a 0-5 scale, increasing
from 0 to 5), pet owned or not, fulltime job or not, region of residence
d. Survey questions:
i. At shelter: Did you stay at a public shelter at any point during the previous
hurricane?
ii. Evacuated: Did you evacuate the area at any point during the previous hurricane? (If you were already evacuated due to a previous hurricane, answer no)
iii. Assistance: I received government assistance during or after this past hurricane in response to that hurricane. (Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)
iv. Risk: The previous hurricane posed a significant risk to myself and my family.
(Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)
v. Dissatisfaction: The government response was *not* fair and adequate. (Response on a
1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)
vi. Property: In the last hurricane, did your primary residence suffer significant property damage?
(Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)
vii. InjuryAdults: In the last hurricane, how many adults in your household over the age of 18 suffered from a significant physical injury?
viii. InjuryChildren: In the last hurricane, how many children in your household under the age of 18 suffered from a significant physical injury?


**Sampling strategy**: Same as for new area post actor survey, included below for convenience.
For each of the surveys conducted either before or after a hurricane, sample 10% of the total population. Use an approach where respondents are revisited for the following hurricane. For example in the post-hurricane surveys, after hurricane 2 we resample the same respondents as for hurricane 1. After we have two _consecutive_ post-hurricane surveys from the same household, we move on to the not yet surveyed potential respondents in the population, in each case trying to create a pairing of a post-hurricane response in hurricane N and N+1. Once all households have been surveyed in 2 consecutive surveys, start over with a fully random sample.




**Other applicable detail**: Either this survey can be re-deployed on the old and new seasons for the original area, or simply the question pertaining to property damage could be asked to the original area post-hurricane survey respondents.
