Specific question:In the answers for TA2A-TA1C-0002-Question6, we are told people’s wealth level “fell near their 4-5 threshold”, and thus wealth for the same person is reported to be 4 and 5 at the same day. We are still confused about the value. Does that mean that if the exact wealth value is above the threshold for wealth level 4, and below threshold for wealth level 5, it’s always possible people report either 4 or 5? How do they choose which value to report based on which threshold the exact value is closer at? (e.g. the threshold for wealth level 4 is 40, and for 5 is 50, if the current exact value is 42, it’s more likely this person will report the value to be 4 instead of 5).Other applicable detail:Answer:In your example, 42 would be reported as 4. A better analogy for the two cases you observed in the data would be if the person's exact value were 49.99.
