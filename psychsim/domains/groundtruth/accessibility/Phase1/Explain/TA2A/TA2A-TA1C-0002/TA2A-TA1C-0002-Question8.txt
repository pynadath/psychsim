Specific question:1. In the hurricane table, is it possible that the hurricane category in different regions are different even on the same day, for the same hurricane? Does the hurricane category at each time stand for: a. The category of hurricane in the hurricane location regionb. The average category of hurricane in all regionsc. The maximal category of hurricane among all regions (Thatâ€™s different from a), as the hurricane location may not necessarily have the maximal hurricane categoryd. Others (please specify)2.  In the original data, if people get injured first (requiring hospitalization), before he/she recovers, can they a.Evacuate?b.Go to a shelter?Other applicable detail:Answer:1. The hurricane table lists all of the hurricanes, so there is only a single hurricane on any day, centered on the region specified in the table. A hurricane has a single category designation, so it does not make sense to talk about a hurricane's region-specific category.2. Both are possible.
