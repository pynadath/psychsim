Specific Question:In the “Post hurricane survey” initial data, one person, aged 31 in Region08 reports wealth to be 4 at time step 82, but in ‘TA2A-TA1C-0012.tsv’, the person aged 31 in Region08 reports wealth to be 5, and we were told this data is also collected at time step 82. Could you address this difference in wealth? (We are sure the two persons are the same, since we were told people don’t travel across regions and there is only one person in region08 aging 30-34 according to CensusTable.tsv.	The same situation appears for one person aged 58 in Region06. As we were told, both ‘TA2A-TA1C-0012.tsv’ and ‘TA2A-TA1C-0032.tsv’ are conducted at time 82 and people will report the wealth at the time when the data is collected, but this person reports wealth to be 5 at ‘TA2A-TA1C-0012.tsv’, and 4 at ‘TA2A-TA1C-0032.tsv’.Other applicable detail:Answer:These are both cases where the person's wealth perception fell near their 4-5 threshold.
