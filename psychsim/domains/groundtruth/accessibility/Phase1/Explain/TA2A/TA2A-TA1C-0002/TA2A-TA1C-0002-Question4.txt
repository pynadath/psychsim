In our previous data request, we were told that there is no “job type” in the simulation. Can we assume that all people who have full time jobs will receive the same amount of salary from the job? Also, can we assume that all people who have full time jobs will receive a salary with the same frequency? (In other words do they get paid every X times, where X is the same for all people who have full time jobs)?Answer:No, you cannot assume either.
