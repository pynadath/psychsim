We asked how many governments there were in the world, and were told that this was not an answerable question. Can we assume that there is no “breakdown” of government agencies, sectors, and there is no independent government in each or some regions in the world? (Since we asked the question whether there are hospitals in some regions and seek detailed information, and were told there is no “breakdown” of different hospitals. We think we can ask similar questions for the government)Answer:Yes, there is no such breakdown.
