Specific question:
We ask for the clarification of survey definition

1. What does the Injured column mean in Post hurricane survey
If one report injured to be yes in post hurricane 4 survey, does that mean that it gets injured in hurricane 4, or does that mean it gets injured before/in hurricane 4(which means 1,2,3,4)

2. What does the Injured column mean in Pre hurricane survey
If one report injured to be yes in pre hurricane 4 survey, does that mean that it gets injured in hurricane 3, or does that mean it gets injured before/in hurricane 3(which means 1,2,3)

3. What does Casualties mean in RegionalTable
If casualties is 1 at time(day) 10, does that mean we have 1 person get injured on day 10, or we have one people seeking hospitalization on day 10(which means they can be injured before day 10)

4. What does Casualties mean in PopulationTable
If casualties is 1 at time(day) 10, does that mean we have 1 person get injured on day 10, or we have one people seeking hospitalization on day 10(which means they can be injured before day 10)

Other applicable detail:
We find some strange facts that we cannot explain:
Why one always reports injured to be yes in all later hurricane after it firstly get injured in one hurricane
Two different people report Injured to be yes in post hurricane 4 survey, but regional table shows only 1 people get injured in region 9 during hurricane 4

Answer:

1. The latter. It would mean that the participant was in an injured state at some point during one of the hurricanes this season (1-4). The challenge description survey questions for the post-hurricane survey (5.d.i-v) should say "previous hurricanes", not just "previous hurricane".
2. There should be no "Injured" column in the Pre hurricane survey.
3. It means we have 1 person who is known to be in an injured state on day 10.
4. It means we have 1 person who is known to be in an injured state on day 10.

Other applicable detail:

The answer to Question #1 should clarify these observations.
