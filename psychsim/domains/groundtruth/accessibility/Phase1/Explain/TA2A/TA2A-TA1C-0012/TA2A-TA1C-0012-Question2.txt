Specific question:
Whats the meaning of dissatisafication in post-hurricane survey?
To be more specific, if dissatisfaction value is high(like 5), does that mean the agent is more satisfied or dissatisfied with the government?

Other applicable detail:
It sounds like if dissatisfaction value is high, agent will be more dissatisfied with the government, but from the description
 Dissatisfaction: The government response was fair and adequate. (Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree)
It seems if dissatisfaction value is high, agent will be more satisfied with the government. Which one is true?

Answer:

More dissatisfied. The challenge description states the survey question in the wrong direction, although it uses the correct label "Dissatisfation". The correct statement would be "The government response was inadequate and unfair."
