Specific question:1) In TA2A-TA1C-0012-RR, we asked people what the category of the most severe hurricane in the past hurricane season was. Does their answer to this question:	a0) Only refer to the most severe hurricane they know about in their region?       a1) Also include the most severe hurricane they heard about from their friends?       a2) Also include the most severe hurricane they heard about from the government report?       Please choose all which are valid2) In TA2A-TA1C-0012-RR , we asked people 10 questions relating to their attitude on evacuation:	i) Whether they will evacuate if there is a potential threat of some property damage	ii)Whether they will evacuate if there is a strong threat of some property damage	iii - x) …	We want to know if people’s answers to those questions are an approximation of their actual attitude, or an exact attitude? Which is to say if two individual’s answers to those 10 questions are the same, does that mean they hold exactly the same attitude towards evacuation, or is it still possible that they may choose differently on the evacuation decision even though the external environment is the same? (but viewed differently by them) Other applicable detail:Answer:1. Everyone in the area knows of the existence of all the hurricanes that pass through the area. However, people may differ in their assessment of severity. If you are asking which of those three are valid with respect to assessing severity of hurricanes, both a1 and a2 are possible. We interpret a0 as being invalid if either a1 or a2 is valid because of its beginning with "Only".2. Even if two individuals answer exactly and identically on those ten conditions, they might still differ in behavior under conditions that do not match any of those ten conditions.
