Specific question:1. We are confused by the response to TA2A-TA1C-0062-RR, as we were told that people get information from public sources like TVs, as we asked in TA2A-TA1C-XXXX-Question3: Are there any news agencies in the world (TV, newspaper, Internet) and we were told ‘no’.  In TA2A-TA1C-0012-RR, we asked whether people get some information from media sources, and the answer was “none” for all respondents(some of them did appear in TA2A-TA1C-0062-RR, where they said they received messages from public sources). The answer is not explained, but we think “none” should mean there is no such media in the world, otherwise they should say “no”, similar to how the answers are provided at TA2A-TA1C-0032-RR.So can we know what kind of information sources exist in the world? We have a hunch that some information outlets exist and we are trying to use a very broad term to ask about this outlet(social media, news agency, government broadcast), and it doesn’t address the correct world for that outlet.Other applicable detail:Answer:The survey for TA2A-TA1-0012-RR asked specifically about media reports of death and casualties, to which the participants responded in the negative.
