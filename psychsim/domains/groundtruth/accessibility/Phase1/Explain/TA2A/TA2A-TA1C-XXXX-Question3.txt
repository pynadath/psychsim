Specific question:1. Are there any news agencies that exist in the world?(TV, Internet, newspaper)? If so, can we ask people about the existence of those agencies?2. We were told in our previous RR that past hurricane information is not accessible. Can we have basic knowledge about when the previous hurricane before time step 1 in our world happens? (It can be as a simple description of “very long ago” or “recently”, we just want to know whether the six accessible hurricanes are a part of a series of hurricanes (e.g. We have 10 hurricanes in 120 days, and those 6 are a part of these 10 hurricanes) or the 6 hurricanes themselves are all of the hurricanes experienced in this short period of time, and the impact from previous hurricanes has little impact on what happened this hurricane season (e.g., people’s risk level has nothing to do with the past hurricane season because it’s a long time ago). This information / understanding should be easily accessible in real-world social research.3. Is it possible people will have part-time jobs in this world and gain salaries from these part-time jobs?Other applicable detail:Answer:1. No2. At least six months ago3. No
