Specific Question:1. We asked before about the location of hospital, and you responded that there is no “hospital location”. Does that mean if people require hospitalization (or are in hospital), they will still be in the region where they live?2. We were told that people will take one day to either evacuate or go to the shelter. We want to clarify the definition of spending one day:If someone decides to evacuate at time 10, will he end in the evacuation list of time 10 (which means when collecting data for the population table, the number of evacuation at time 10 will include this one, who decides to evacuate at time 10), or will this one only be counted as “in evacuation” at time 11.The same question applies to those going to the shelter.Other applicable detail:Answer:1. Yes.2. Taking one day to move means that a move that is initiated on day 10 will complete on day 11, so it would be the latter of the two cases you list.
