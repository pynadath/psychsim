1. Can we be sure that “TA2A-TA1C-0042Damage.tsv” only accounts for the asset loss, and has nothing to do with the physical injury? (Since our questions only ask for asset loss, is the data based only on that?)2. Can we be sure that there is no other type of asset loss in the world other than the wealth loss of each individual in the world? (e.g. public wealth, open facility). Since we are provided with government statistics, we should know what kind of damage is included in that data.Answer:As stated, the file contains assessment of damage to the region, not to people. However, it is not possible to make a blanket statement that the assessment has nothing to do with other factors. Nor is there an available breakdown of the component factors of the assessment.
