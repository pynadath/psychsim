1. We are only given the damage report for each hurricane, can we assume that’s all the asset loss in the world? Is it possible that there will be asset loss before/after hurricanes (not directly caused by a hurricane strike)?2. Can we be sure that the government’s damage report is completely accurate (They have their criteria to measure, but there won’t be a scenario where the government cannot access some people’s wealth loss, or people report false information to the government)?3. Can we at least know whether the damage report (we assume it’s all asset damage since our question is only about asset loss) only accounts for the total wealth loss for each individual in the region, or are there other types of damage like the damage in public property? (Since we get data from the government, in a social dataset it’s reasonable that we know what this data means, and what will be taken into consideration when collecting this data).1. It is possible.2. The government may not always have complete information about individual wealth.3. If the question is whether the damage report can be equated to total wealth loss, then the answer is no. Total wealth loss is unavailable, so we provided an available government report on regional damage as a substitute.
