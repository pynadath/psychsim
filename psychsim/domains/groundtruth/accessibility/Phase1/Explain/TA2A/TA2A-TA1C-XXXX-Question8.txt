Specific question:Does government take some action before the hurricane lands? (Any measures they take to reduce the possible damage caused by the hurricane) If so, can we directly ask that, and what kind of “term” should we use to ask that question? (We just want to reduce the time for getting new data, in case we get no response because we don’t use the right term).Other applicable detail:Answer:The response to TA2A-TA1C-0052-RR is complete with respect to government action.
