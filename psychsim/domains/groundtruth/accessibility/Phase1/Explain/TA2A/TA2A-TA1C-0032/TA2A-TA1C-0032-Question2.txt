Specific questions:1. In response to TA2A-TA1C-0032RR, question 5. We asked people to report different “types” of government actions, but people only reported the same kind of action conducted several times (e.g. give aid to region 01, 02, 03). So, can we assume that all this “aid” is of the same type, and will it have the same type of effects? We prefer people to answer different types of actions instead of one action several times. If people only report one type of action (which is giving aid), can we assume for this person, he/she doesn’t know of any other types of government action?2. In response to TA2A-TA1C-0032-RR, people report Problem 1, 2 and 3. For one possible response: “My wealth suffered”, if people’s wealth is 4 at timestep 1, and experienced some wealth decrease at some point during the hurricane, and later the wealth goes back to 4 or 5, will people a) Still report “My wealth suffered”, since they experience the wealth decrease b) Not report “My wealth suffered”, since it only compares the wealth at the beginning of  the hurricane season, and at the time when TA2A-TA1C-0032-RR survey is conducted c) Others, please describe3. If people’s wealth only decreases because of the money they spend on evacuation (As we were told that’s possible), will people also report “My wealth suffered” in that case?Answer:1. These were the five most salient acts by the government (with 1 being the most salient) that the person observed.2. Both (a) and (b) are possible.3. Possibly.
