Specific question:We were told in TA2A-TA1C-0032-RR that people may claim that their wealth suffers during the hurricane season either because they have net wealth decrease, or they have experienced any wealth decrease during the hurricane. Does that mean that people under both conditions (net wealth decrease during the whole hurricane season; or wealth decrease during any hurricanes in previous season) will all report “my wealth suffers”, or some people will report this under the first condition, and some others will report under the second? If so, can we directly ask them under what situations, will they report “my wealth suffers”?Other applicable detail:Answer:You cannot ask them about under what hypothetical situations they may or may not report as such, but you could ask more specific questions (distinguishing between the two case) about their actual experiences.
