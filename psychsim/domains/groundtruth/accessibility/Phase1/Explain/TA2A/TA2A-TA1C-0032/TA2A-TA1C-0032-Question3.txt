One person (Region 9, age 31, male) in response TA2A-TA1C-0032-RR reported that his wealth suffered. However, his wealth level is 5 at that time. As far as we know, 5 is the highest wealth level, and we were told in a clarification question that people will report that “My wealth suffered” if they experienced net wealth loss during the hurricane season. So, why would a person report “My wealth suffered” even if his wealth level is 5 at the end of the hurricane?

Answer:

If the clarification question being referred to is "TA2A-TA1C-0032-Question2.txt", then our response was "Both (a) and (b) are possible." So the assumption made about this person in the above statement is unjustified.
