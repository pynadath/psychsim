Specific Question:1. In initial data, we have the survey report at certain time steps. We want to know if people respond to the survey at the end of the day, or at the beginning of the day? In other words, did they know all the things that happened in that day before they finished the survey? For example, do they know the actual hurricane category of that day, how many/whether their family members have been injured?2. In the “Hurricane Table”, we have the hurricane category before and after the hurricane has landed. We want to know:a. Did all the people know about the hurricane category? If not, can we get data on how this information is spread?b. Is the category before landing a prediction of the actual hurricane? Is it conducted everyday(e.g. For the hurricane category at time 6, the prediction is conducted at time 5, and broadcast at time 5, and people will know about the predicted category before they answer our pre-hurricane survey?) Or, is it a recording of the actual hurricane category in the sea, which is generated at the end of the specific day(e.g. Hurricane category at time 6(before landing) is recorded at the end of time 6). Answer:1. Participants will know what happened up to the time of answering the survey, which may be at any time during the day.2a. These data are not directly available, but can be asked of people.2b. The HurricaneTable contains the actual category on a given the day (as specified by the Timestep field). Timing of the recording during the day is not available.
