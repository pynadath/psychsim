Specific question:1. We are not sure what kind of change TA1 makes on the regional damage table: In our setting, we specify the regional damage in region06 and region09, is that changed to region01 and region05(With the damage level unchanged)? For people living in other regions of the world, do they get the regional damage for their own region? Or, do they not know the regional damage in their regions? 2. Is the hurricane path in the simulated hurricane table changed? (Since TA1 says all region06 and region09 in our files are changed to region01 and region05, we want to verify that)Also some similar questions:	Does region06 and region09 change in simulatedAid?		Does region06 and region09 change in simulatedWeather prediction?3. In 0082RR.tsv, we have the risk/severity level reported at each time. We suspect the ‘risk/severity’ level reported before the hurricane lands, is indeed the risk level (whose meaning is the same as risk in post-hurricane survey), but not the severity level (whose meaning is the same as severity in pre-hurricane survey). Is that true?   4. For the variable ‘Injury Sensitivity’ and ‘Asset Loss Sensitivity’. The higher the level is, the more likely this person will choose to evacuate if there is risk for injury/asset loss, is that the correct interpretation?Other applicable detail:Answer:1. Yes, the specified damage levels were applied to Region01 and Region05. Participants from other regions were free to interpret the effect on their own regions as they woud.2. Sorry for the overly general wording, but no, we did not change the hurricane path. But we did replace the regions in the simulated aid and weather predictions.3. No, we followed the wording in the request, asking for "severity" before the hurricane lands, and "risk" subsequently.4. No, the direction of the sensitivity was not specified in the item (i.e., higher levels may also indicate an increasingly lower likelihood of choosing to evacuate).
