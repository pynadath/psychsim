Specific question:1. Can we ask for the “aid request” (which is the request sent to the government asking for aid to some region)that the government receives? If so, can you describe what kind of data we can possibly get (the format and content)? We want to know whether it is relevant to ask such questions.2. Is there a value specifying under which conditions people will seek government help? If so, can we ask people directly to make them describe the situations where they want government help?Other applicable detail:Answer:1. There are no such requests.2. People do not seek government help.
