# Specific question #
1. We are having difficulty interpreting the variable ‘Aid for Experience Hurricane X’.
An example would be, the only person from region13 in table TA2A-TA1C-0152-RR, it says she thought aid should be sent to region13 at timestep 8, and indeed aid was sent to region13 at timestep 8, but still ‘Aid for Experience Hurricane 1’ is ‘no’(the way we interpret this variable is, if aid was sent to the region where one person thinks it should be sent to, then, if that’s true, aid for experience hurricane 1 should be ‘yes’ instead of ‘no’ in this case). Similar problems also appear in variable ‘Unfair Aid Region Hurricane 1’ and ‘Unfair Aid Should Have Aided Hurricane 1’ where this person from region13 thought aid should be sent to region13, and it did, but this person still thought it was unfair aid. Why is that?
   2. For variable ‘Aid Timestep Hurricane X’, if one person receives aid in multiple timesteps during one hurricane, which aid instance would it report (e.g. The earliest one? The latest one? Random one?)
   3. For variable ‘Timestep Should Have Been Aided Hurricane X’, if one person has several such experiences (thinking aid should be sent to some region) during one hurricane, which instance would it report? (e.g. The earliest one? The latest one? Random one?)
   4. For variable ‘Unfair Aid Should Have Aided Hurricane X’, if one person has several such experiences (thinking aid should be sent to some region) during one hurricane, which instance would it report? (e.g. The earliest one? The latest one? Random one?)
   5. For variable ‘Dissatisfaction Change Hurricane X’, does that value mean the total amount of dissatisfaction level change during one hurricane, or does that only stand for the dissatisfaction level change for that one instance (the instance which people think the aid should be sent to them, but actually arrive/not arrive)
   6. Is the ‘Dissatisfaction Change Hurricane X’ in the same scale as changes in reported ‘Dissatisfaction’ in Post-hurricane survey? (E.g. if ‘Dissatisfaction Change Hurricane’ is -2 in RR0015, does that mean that reported dissatisfaction will also drop from Y to Y-2 in post-hurricane survey?)

# Answer # 

1. We (and subsequently the actors) did not fully understand your intent with that item and responded with some incorrect days. We have uploaded a revised survey file (TA2A-TA1C-0152-R1).

2. We cannot directly answer that.

3. We cannot directly answer that.

4. We cannot directly answer that.

5. Just that one instance.

6. Not necessarily.
