# Specific question #
       We request researchers live with people from Phase I through a future hurricane and conduct interviews with the people that they live with, reporting the following information on each day. Before the hurricane arrives, we will collect the following information in the context of an initial evaluation:
   a. The demographic information of people with whom researchers live, including: Age, Number of Children, Ethnicity, whether they possess a Full time Job, Gender, Pets, and Religion.
   b. How vulnerable does this person feel he/she is against the hurricane. (Rating 1-5, 1 for least vulnerable and 5 for most vulnerable)
   c. Number of each person’s friends.
   d. How much does the person agree with the following sentence:
	I should receive government aid if I suffer wealth loss (only count the wealth loss caused by hurricane strike, not including the fees for evacuation and other expenses). 
	(0 to 6, with 0 indicating completely disagree, and 6 indicating 100% agree).

    e1. Have you ever made new friends during a previous hurricane season? (all 6 previous hurricanes)
    e2. If so, list at most 3 reasons you make new friends.

We want to collect the following information on each day (please also record which day it is on each day):
   0. Wealth level of this person.
1. The hurricane category reported on that day whose source is:
a. Government public broadcast
b. Social media
c. Friends
d. Other (List one other source and the value reported)
	(NA if not reported from that source)
   2. The hurricane location reported on that day whose source is:
e. Government public broadcast
f. Social media
g. Friends
h. Other (List one other source and the value reported)
	(NA if not reported from that source)
   3. The regional damage reported on that day whose source is:
i. Government public broadcast
j. Social media
k. Friends
l. Other (List one other source and the value reported)
	(NA if not reported from that source)
    4. The current shelter policy reported from social media
	i) Whether pets are allowed (or not)
	ii) Whether children are allowed (or not)
	iii) The maximal personal wealth allowed to be accepted into shelter
    5. The current shelter policy reported from government public broadcast
	i) Whether pets are allowed (or not)
	ii) Whether children are allowed (or not)
	iii) The maximal wealth allowed to be accepted into shelter
    6. The current shelter policy reported from friends
	i) Whether pets are allowed (or not)
	ii) Whether children are allowed (or not)
	iii) The maximal wealth allowed to be accepted into shelter
    
    7. The location of the person with whom the researcher lives (home/evacuation/shelter)
    8. Perceived minor injury likelihood(0 - 6 , 0 for 0%, 6 for 100%)
    9. Perceived serious injury likelihood(0 - 6 , 0 for 0%, 6 for 100%)
    10. Perceived likelihood to enter shelter(0 - 6 , 0 for 0%, 6 for 100%)
    11. Dissatisfaction level on each day
    12. Whether has minor injury (or not) on each day
    13. Whether has serious injury (or not) on each day
    14. Whether children have minor injury (or not) on each day.
    15. Whether children have serious injury (or not) on each day.
    16. Whether receive government aid on each day
    17. Whether receive acquaintance aid on each day
    18. Whether gives out aid to acquaintances on each day.
    19. Wealth change on each day (-5 to 5, with -5 for greatest wealth decrease and +5 for greatest wealth increase; 0 for doesn’t change).
	

# Sampling strategy #
We want to randomly select 8 people across all 16 regions, and send researchers to live with each of them. We recognize that this is high-risk research, and yet we believe that the insight gained for the government, public health, and the people outweighs the substantial costs and risks associated with real-time evaluation of this type. 
     Also keep in mind that we want researchers to start living with them at least 2 or 3 days before any hurricane forms. (We understand the prediction of hurricane landing might be wrong, so we intend to make it 3, but no later than 2). And researchers should leave their home 2 days after the hurricane has left (not 2 days after the entering a ‘leaving’ state). The report should also include at least 2 days before hurricane forms, the entire hurricane period, and 2 days following the hurricane.
