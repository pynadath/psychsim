# Research method category #
Environmental data

# Specific question #
We want to ask the government for the following data:
1)‘Hurricane table’ for the past 20 hurricanes.
(Record the category, location, state (land or not, or leaving) on each day the hurricane exists)
   2) ‘Hurricane prediction table’ for the past 20 hurricanes.
		(We already know the government will have hurricane prediction for each hurricane, so we want to see the records for the day when the prediction is created, the predicted path and category, and also the time when the prediction is broadcasted to the public)
   3) ‘Landfall table’ for the past 20 hurricanes.
		(We want to see the record for the level of landfall on each region, each day as the hurricane exists)
