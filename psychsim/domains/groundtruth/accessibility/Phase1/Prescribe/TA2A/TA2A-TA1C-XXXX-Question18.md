# Specific question #
As in our prescription task, we are asked unconstrained questions like ‘what should government do?’. So we want to know what are the things government can do, specifically:
a. Can the government impose taxes?
b. Can the government government issue ‘voluntary evacuation warning’?
c. Can the government government issue ‘mandatory evacuation order’?
d. Can the government broadcast hurricane prediction?
e. Can the government change the policy for entering shelter?
f. Please list other possible government actions as well.
On the other hand, we also want to know the limits of government resources(otherwise government maybe able to send aid to all regions on the same day, or open shelter to everyone, etc) So we want to know
	i) Constraints for all possible government actions(e.g. Only give aid to one region at a time, and the impact of the aid is the same for all aids)
	ii) Can we increase the capacity of government actions by imposing supplementary policy(e.g. In Prediction Phase, you mentioned government can impose 15% taxes, and increase the aid impact by 25%). If so, we want to know the correspondence between the supplementary policy and the increased capacity of government actions(e.g. If impose a tax of X% can increase the aid impact by Y%, what is the relationship between X and Y).


# Other applicable details #

# Answer # 

a. We're eliminating taxes as a possibility, as they complicate evaluation across the different instances (e.g., due to different wealth). You can assume that the government has sufficient funds to support any plausible prescription.

b. Yes.

c. Yes.

d. Yes.

e. Yes.

f. There is no pre-specified constraint on government actions or resources limit, but all interventions must be socially plausible.
