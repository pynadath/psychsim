Specific questions:
	We want to ask people the following questions:

	Part I: Personal Information
1. Your demographic information, including
a. Age
b. Gender
c. Ethnicity
d. Residency
e. Religion
f. Pets
g. Full time job
h. # Children
i. The wealth (on the day you respond to the survey)
    2) The number of friends living out of your own region
    3) The number of friends living in the same region as you
    4) The date you respond to the survey
    5) How vulnerable you think you are against the hurricane (1-5, 1 for least vulnerable)
    6) How much does the person agree with the following sentence:
	I should receive government aid if I suffer wealth loss (only count the wealth loss caused by hurricane strike, not including the fees for evacuation and other expenses). 
	(0 to 6, with 0 indicating completely disagree, and 6 indicating 100% agree).

	Part II: Opinions on possible policies:
       We propose 8 candidate policies:
       a) Give anyone payment if they evacuate, the amount of payment is equal to wealth level 2.
       b) Give government aid based on hurricane’s current location if hurricane has landed (For example, if hurricane is currently at region02, aid will be provided to region02 on that day)
c) Shelters allow all people from all regions, with or without pets and children, with wealth level no more than 2 to enter.
d) Once people get injured, give them payment which equals to wealth level 2.
e) Mandatorily evacuate people whose age is more than 60 before the hurricane lands and their evacuation cost will be covered by the government
f) Mandatorily evacuate people of minority ethnicity before the hurricane lands and their evacuation cost will be covered by the government
g) Mandatorily evacuate people with children before the hurricane lands and their evacuation cost will be covered by the government
h) Send government officials go door to door and make sure everyone in the area knows the hurricane prediction issued by government before the hurricane lands.

1. Please order aforementioned 8 policies based on its effectiveness to reduce your own dissatisfaction. (The first one would be the one which reduces your dissatisfaction most or keeps your dissatisfaction at the lowest level)
2. Please order aforementioned 8 policies based on its effectiveness to reduce your own self-reported injury possibility. (The first one would be the one which reduce your self-reported injury possibility most or keep your self-reported injury possibility at the lowest level)
3. Please order aforementioned 8 policies based on its effectiveness to reduce your own self-reported risk level. (The first one would be the one which reduce your self-reported risk level most or keep your self-reported risk level at the lowest level)
4. Please order aforementioned 8 policies based on its effectiveness to reduce your own number of injury instances. (The first one would be the one which reduce your number of injury instances most or keep your number of injury instances at the lowest level)
5. Please order aforementioned 8 policies based on its effectiveness to reduce the overall dissatisfaction in your region. (The first one would be the one which reduces the overall dissatisfaction most or keep the overall dissatisfaction at the lowest level))
6. Please order aforementioned 8 policies based on its effectiveness to reduce the overall number of injury instances in your region. (The first one would be the one which reduce your number of injury instances in your region the most or keep the overall number of injury instances in your region at the lowest level)

	* Note:
i) We expect people to answer those questions based on their experience in latest previous hurricane season(e.g. For people in the Explain world, in the 6 hurricanes they just experienced(and we have data for), what will happen(reduce dissatisfaction/reduce injury, etc) if one of those 8 policies is set for those 6 hurricanes)
ii) For policy b), we only change government aid when hurricane has landed, no change for aid before or after hurricane has landed.
iii) If this person thinks one policy won’t have an effect on the targeted variable (e.g. Policy a) doesn’t change its own dissatisfaction level, which is asked in question 1), then policy a) should not be included in the final list)




# Sampling strategy #
We want to randomly sample 10% of people from the world in Explain Phase, and all the worlds in Prescribe Phase.


# Other applicable detail #
As in the real world, it is common for the government to do an ‘investigation’ for possible new policies before they make a decision, so this kind of research should be possible based on our understanding.
