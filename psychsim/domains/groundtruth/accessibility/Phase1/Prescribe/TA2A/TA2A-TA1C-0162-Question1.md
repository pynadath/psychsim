As in TA2A-TA1C-0052-RR, the government reported that they sent aid to region05 at timesteps 76, 77. However, participants 2,5,7(who are located in region05) in TA2A-TA1C-0162-RR reported they didn’t receive government aid at timestep 76 and 77. Is it correct the we interpreted this action as the government sending aid to region05, but participants 2, 5, 7 didn’t receive them?
