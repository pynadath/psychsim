# Specific question #
1. The regional damage reported for TA2A-TA1C-0182-RR is:
a. The regional damage received only from social media
b. The regional damage received from all sources
c. Others, please specify
	Which one is correct?
   2. The Injury/Death/Shelter Possibility reported TA2A-TA1C-0182-RR, is:
a. Possibility calculated based on information only from social media
b. Possibility calculated based on information from all sources
c. Others, please specify
	Which one is correct?
   3. For the information in TA2A-TA1C-0182-RR which claims to be from social media, does that also include communication with friends via social media?
   4. In TA2A-TA1C-0162-RR, we see Participant 2’s Minor Injury Likelihood to be 6(which should be 100% likely to get minor injury), but indeed not (minorly) injured. In TA2A-TA1C-0182-RR, we see Shelter likelihood to be 6 if and only if people actually sheltered(e.g. Participant 10)
	So we want to know:
a. Is it true that the perceived likelihood for shelter will be 6 if and only if people actually shelter on that day?
b. Is it true that even if the perceived injury likelihood is 6, it is still possible people won’t get injured?
c. How about serious injury likelihood and death likelihood, does that fall into the type of a) or b)?
   5. Does the ‘Injury possibility’ in TA2A-TA1C-0182-RR only stand for ‘serious injury’?
