# Specific question #

We want to arrange for researchers to live with some residents during one hurricane and record information each day. 
	Residents that participate in the research project (The people our researchers live with) *must* obey the following rule:
They are only allowed to receive information from social media. (Which means they cannot accept government broadcasts, government warnings, talk with their friends, talk with acquaintances, walk out of the door to gather information, or receive hurricane-related information from any other sources not mentioned above).
	As a reward, we will support their wealth to level 5(maximal) in the beginning of this hurricane, and will cover all financial losses during this hurricane. (This means for people collaborating with us, their wealth will always be 5 during this hurricane).
	
	I) We want to collect the following information at the beginning of the hurricane
a. Demographic information:
	Age
	Gender
	Ethnicity
	Religion
	Residency
	Number of children
	Pets
	Full time job
	Wealth at the beginning of the hurricane(before accepting our condition and wealth changed to level 5)
	    b) List all sources you receive information from during the hurricane. (Or list as many as possible)

	II) We want to extract all hurricane-related information this person read from social media on each day, it can be done with the following steps:
	1. If it is from a social media post, insert reference to that post/website and record related information(including the time of reading, the url link of the page, etc).
	2. If it is from the TV, record the time and the TV stations watched.
	3. If it is from the newspaper, record the reading time and the name of that newspaper.
	After that, evaluate the information and record all things related to the hurricane. (We can also ask people what they learned by reading certain materials to help process the information)
	We want the information to be recorded in the following format:

	Time      Information Type         Value           Other Notes
An example would be
	86        Regional Damage       Extreme severe          None

	* There won’t be privacy issues as telling researchers what they read during hurricane will also be part of the conditional offer we provide.

	III) We want to collect the following information on each day during the hurricane
1. Location (home, evacuation, shelter)
2. Shelter policy heard 
Specifically:
	a. Whether pets are allowed
	b. Whether children are allowed? (If so, how many are allowed(maximal) for one adult)
	c. Maximal wealth level allowed to enter
	d. Restrictions based on where evacuees live (e.g. must be in same areal unit as the shelter)
3. Hurricane category on each day
4. Hurricane location on each day
5. Possibility of injury on each day(0 - 6, with 0 for 0%, 6 for 100%)
6. Possibility of death on each day(0 - 6, with 0 for 0%, 6 for 100%)
7. Possibility of shelter on each day(0 - 6, with 0 for 0%, 6 for 100%)
8. Regional Damage on each day(1-5, with 1 for least severe and 5 for most severe)

* This information is based on personal reports, it can be different from the information people receive from social media, an example would be news on TV that says the hurricane category is 4, but people still report it to be 3 because they may not believe the news report that day. However, keep in mind that people can only gather information from social media.	

# Sampling strategy #

We want to send our request to all people across 16 regions and accept volunteer participation. This experiment is open to all and we expect random distribution of participants across all regions.
