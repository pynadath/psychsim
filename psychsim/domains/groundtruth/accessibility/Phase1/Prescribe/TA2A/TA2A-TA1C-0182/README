We implement this as a survey about the last hurricane, as the future hurricanes are being used for the evaluation of prescriptions. The actors thus report on only what social-media information they received and the locations they were actually at (not what locations they might have been at if they had received only social-media information).

The instances to be used are not specified, so we use the six prescribe challenge instances (9-14).

We sampled 10% of the population.

There are three files per instance: TA2A-TA1C-0182-Initial describing the participants (I), TA2A-TA1C-0182-Information with the information received (II), and TA2A-TA1C-0182-Journal with their personal reports (III).

II. More specific media sources are not available.

III.2: The actors do not hear anything about the shelter policy.
