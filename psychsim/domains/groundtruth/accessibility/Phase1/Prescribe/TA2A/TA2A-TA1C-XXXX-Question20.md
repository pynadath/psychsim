# Specific question #
We want to check if those policies are possible to submit as our final solution for the Prescribe Phase:
1. Direct Aid
a. Direct aid to regions: We decide which region should government give aid to on each day (If it is allowed, how many regions can we direct aid to on each day(maximal), and can we specify the effect of the aid, or do we just say giving aid?)
b. Direct aid based on demographic information: We decide the region to give aid to based on demographic information(e.g. Give aid to people of minority ethnicity, give aid to the female people)
c. Direct aid based on incidents: Can we give aid only to people injured/evacuated etc?
2. Give payment
 . WhatÕs the maximal amount of payment(financial aid, the effect is to increase peopleÕs wealth) we can give to one person; How many people can receive aid maximal(during one hurricane or on one day)
a. How can we specify the target of payment(based on regions? based on demographic information? Based on incidents? Other methods?)
3. Mandatory evacuation order
 . How many people can we send mandatory evacuation order to on each day(or during one hurricane)
a. Can can we specify the target of evacuation order(based on regions? based on demographic information? Based on incidents? Other methods?)
4. Shelter policy
 . Can we change the policy to allow people with pets during the entire hurricane?
a. Can we change the maximal wealth value requirement for entering shelter? (If yes, whatÕs the maximal possible value, it seems not possible that we allow everyone to get into shelter(with their pets))
