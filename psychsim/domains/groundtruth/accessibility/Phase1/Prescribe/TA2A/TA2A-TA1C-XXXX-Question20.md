We want to check if those policies are possible to submit as our final solution for the Prescribe Phase:
1. Direct Aid
a. Direct aid to regions: We decide which region should government give aid to on each day (If it is allowed, how many regions can we direct aid to on each day(maximal), and can we specify the effect of the aid, or do we just say giving aid?)
b. Direct aid based on demographic information: We decide the region to give aid to based on demographic information(e.g. Give aid to people of minority ethnicity, give aid to the female people)
c. Direct aid based on incidents: Can we give aid only to people injured/evacuated etc?
2. Give payment
 . What’s the maximal amount of payment(financial aid, the effect is to increase people’s wealth) we can give to one person; How many people can receive aid maximal(during one hurricane or on one day)

3. Mandatory evacuation order

4. Shelter policy
