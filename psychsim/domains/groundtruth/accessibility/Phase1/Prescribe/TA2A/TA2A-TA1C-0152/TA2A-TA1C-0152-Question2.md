# Specific question #

1.For the variable ÒDissatisfaction Change Hurricane XÓ, does it mean:
a. The overall dissatisfaction changed during this hurricane?
b. The dissatisfaction change caused by this single instance (As this question follows the question Ôwhen do you think you should receive governmentÕ, The dissatisfaction change might only describe the change caused by the aid expectation on that single day)
c. Others, please specify

2. We are confused by the fact that some people report that they think they should have been given aid, and the government did give them the aid, and they still report aid to be ÔnoÕ for that day.(An example would be, for participant 8, it reports ÔAid Timestep Hurricane 1Õ to be 8(which means it received aid on day 8). Then it also reports ÔTimestep Should Have Been Aided Hurricane 1Õ to be 8, and ÔAid for Experience Hurricane 1Õ to be no(which should have answered the question -- For the time it think it should be given aid, did it actually receive aid or not?) We want to know the reason for this contradiction.Ê
