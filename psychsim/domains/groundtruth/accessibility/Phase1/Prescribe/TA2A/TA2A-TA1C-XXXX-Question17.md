# Specific question #

When we use the following three ‘terms’(1. Social Media 2. Government broadcast/public broadcast 3. Friends) to describe information sources in our RRs, we want to know how you interpret it. Specifically:
Does each of these sources exist in the simulated world?
Does any two ‘source terms’ include the same information outlet (e.g. if information from TV are both interpreted as ‘social media’ and ‘Government broadcast’, and the information from this outlet will be included in both two categories, which is the thing we don’t need to see)?

Please specify if
Any source doesn’t exist
Any source pairs that contain the same information outlet(s)
in your response.

All of the channels exist, but not all may be used in a given instance. Broadcasts are distinguished from social media (1 vs. 2), but friends may communicate via social media (1 vs. 3).
