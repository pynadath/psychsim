# Specific question #

1. In our question III.3, we specified:

You are not allowed to label different sources with the same level of trust(so essentially you need to order your trust on those sources)

But in the answers we get, all participants say their trust in government is at the same level as trust in friends. Could you change the level so that we can distinguish their trust between those two? (Or, if the trust is indeed exactly the same, can you tell us that in your response, the level can be the same unless the trust is exactly the same for the two sources)

   2. In TA2A-TA1C-0132-RR, we know people hear a ‘regional damage level’ each day. In TA2A-TA1C-0192-RR, all people report ‘regional damage level’ is not from family/friends/acquaintances/social media/government, is it correct that we interpret it as coming from ‘people’s own observation’? If not, could you tell us the source of regional damage? (As weird as it is, all possible sources we can think of, or documented in existing papers all fall into one of the 5 categories we mentioned in our opinion).
