# Specific question #

In TA2A-TA1C-0042-RR, we were told the regional damage level is the maximum regional damage level in each hurricane. However, according to TA2A-TA1C-0182-RR, the maximum regional damage level reported by people exceeds the maximum regional damage level in TA2A-TA1C-0042-RR(e.g. Participant 2 in TA2A-TA1C-0182-RR reports regional damage to be 5 on day 77, but data in TA2A-TA1C-0042-RR shows the max regional damage is 3 for region10(where participant 2 locates in). Could you explain the contradiction?

TA2A-TA1C-0042-RR asked for a "Brief from expert observer / Interview of government experts". TA2A-TA1C-0182-RR asked for a "Journal", so it is a survey of residents.
