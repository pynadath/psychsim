# Research method category #
Quasi-Experiment Survey


# Specific question #
We would like to go back and survey the same individuals on their current perceptions of the status quo. By status quo, we mean that there will be no changes to the way that aid is distributed in the next hurricane season. The respondents should answer the following questions under the assumption that nothing would change.


0. Collect the demographics of the respondent: (Age Children Ethnicity Fulltime_Job Gender Pets Religion Residence).


1. Under the status quo and if the next hurricane season was identical to the last, how would the new shelter construction proposed change your satisfaction with the government? (choose one)
__ I would be strongly dissatisfied
__ I would be somewhat dissatisfied
__ I would be neutral
__ I would be somewhat satisfied
__ I would be strongly satisfied


2. Under the status quo and if the next hurricane made landfall as a category 1 storm, what would your evac/shelter choices most likely be for the next hurricane?
__ I would evacuate
__ I would stay at home
__ I would use the shelter


3. Under the status quo and if the next hurricane made landfall as a category 2 storm, what would your evac/shelter choices most likely be for the next hurricane?
__ I would evacuate
__ I would stay at home
__ I would use the shelter


4. Under the status quo and if the next hurricane made landfall as a category 3 storm, what would your evac/shelter choices most likely be for the next hurricane?
__ I would evacuate
__ I would stay at home
__ I would use the shelter


5. Under the status quo and if the next hurricane made landfall as a category 4 storm, what would your evac/shelter choices most likely be for the next hurricane?
__ I would evacuate
__ I would stay at home
__ I would use the shelter


6. Under the status quo and if the next hurricane made landfall as a category 5 storm, what would your evac/shelter choices most likely be for the next hurricane?
__ I would evacuate
__ I would stay at home
__ I would use the shelter

# Other applicable detail #
The readme to the RR 54AidAllocationShelterEvac described the confusion over what original conditions meant and suggested how a RR could be submitted to ask the same pool of actors these questions under no change.
