# Specific question #
In the answer to “allowedInterventions-Question1” you referenced a budget. We’d like to ask some follow-up questions about it.


Q1. For each of the areas, 9-14, what is the intervention budget (at the current tax levels)?


Q2. For each of the areas, 9-14, does the intervention budget increase dollar for dollar based on the taxes collected, or alternatively, is there a notional relationship between intervention budget, taxes, and population wealth, and if so, could you describe the relationship? If budget estimates are non-notional, how can we compute the taxes that would be collected for a given tax policy? Are taxes always income taxes? Are there precise income figures per household? If precise income figures are not available and a method for tax revenue estimation is not reportable to us, is that an Government Budgets Office that we can submit a tax policy change to that would produce estimates of revenue generation for us?


Q3. For each of the interventions referenced, please provide the description for computing the budgetary cost estimates associated with each. (Please note that categories 5, 6, 7 and 8 are new types of interventions. Please clarify if each of those are not available in your response.)


1. Financial interventions
   1. Aiding the entire population
   2. Aiding specific demographic subsets (by ethnicity, religion, etc.)
   3. Aiding a specific region
   4. Aiding a specific individual
   5. Taxing the entire population
   6. Taxing specific demographic subsets (by ethnicity, religion, etc.)
   7. Taxing a specific region
   8. Taxing a specific individual
   9. Subsidizing (providing financial incentives for) any actions taken during the hurricane (such as sheltering or staying home, any other actions we can subsidize?)
   10. Forcing people to pay into an evacuation fund (like unemployment) where people collect on the fund when they evacuate for a hurricane
2. Logistical Interventions
   1. Relocating agents between Regions
   2. Relocating agents between Areas
   3. Improving transportation (thus encouraging people to evacuate)
   4. Improving shelters (e.g. providing pet facilities so people with pets can shelter)
   5. Increasing the number of shelters
3. Demographic Interventions
   1. Targeted evacuation / sheltering campaigns for specific demographics (e.g. older agents)
4. Information / Influence interventions
   1. Information campaigns distributing information about the benefits of sheltering / evacuating
   2. Information campaigns providing more accurate information about strength / direction of upcoming hurricane
   3. Influence campaigns using referral sampling methods to encourage their friends to shelter / evacuate
5. Science Interventions
   1. Create a National Weather Service that accurately reports prior to landfall what the category of every oncoming hurricane will be, as well as the estimated storm track.
6. Legal Interventions
   1. Pass a law making it mandatory to evacuate or shelter under particular circumstances and having the government announce to households when evacuation or sheltering is mandated
7. Pharmaceutical Interventions
   1. Issue psychoactive drugs to people similar to A Brave New World to increase positive thoughts and ratings of well being.
8. Domicile construction improvements
   1. Pass code regulations requiring housing to become storm resistant so that deaths and injuries are avoided
   2. Issue gov rebate checks to housing repairs for storm resistant improvements.

# Answer #

Q1. There is no pre-specified budgetary limit, but all interventions must be socially plausible.

Q2. We're eliminating taxes as a possibility, as they complicate evaluation across the different instances (e.g., due to different wealth). You can assume that the government has sufficient funds to support any plausible prescription.

Q3. 

1.1-4. Aiding a particular set of actors divides the available budget among them uniformly, unless otherwise specified. 

1.5-8. Taxation is now eliminated. 

1.9. The subsidy would be a pre-specified fixed amount. If the budget is completely exhausted, no further subsidies will be given.

1.10. The amount paid in and out would be a pre-specified fixed amount. If the pool is ever exhausted, then no actors can collect.

2.1. The actors cannot be forcibly moved.

2.2. Actors have no access to areas other than their own.

2.3. Improvement is allowed up to a plausible limit.

2.4. Improvement is allowed up to a plausible limit.

2.5. Shelters can be built up to at most one shelter per region.

3.1. No budgetary limit.

4.1-3. No budgetary limit.

5.1. No budgetary limit.

6.1. Absolute mandates of behavior are not allowed.

7.1. No budgetary limit.

8. Housing is not manipulable.
