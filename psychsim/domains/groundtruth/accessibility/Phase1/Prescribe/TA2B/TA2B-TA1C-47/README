The methodology followed here was identical to TA2B-TA1C-32PairedPredictSurveys. The README for that request applies here as well:

We sampled taking the initial survey pools as our starting sets of participants and then administered the survey to each of them again for the subsequent hurricane. This does not exactly match the requested sampling strategy, but this is being done over a population that has already been sampled for these surveys (instead of over a population being sampled for the first time as in the previous request). 

If a participant happened to be sampled for two consecutive hurricanes in the original survey, the participant number for the second response has been changed to match the number used in the first response.

If the response to a work-related question is "N/A", then the participant does not have a fulltime job at any point during a hurricane.
