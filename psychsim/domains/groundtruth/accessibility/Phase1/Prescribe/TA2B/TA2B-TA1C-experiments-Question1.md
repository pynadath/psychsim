# Specific question #
Are we allowed to run experiments during the IDP timeline? Or is that time considered to have elapsed? If we’re allowed to run experiments, then can the experiments test for quantities relevant to the prescribe questions, like evacuation?


# Other applicable details #


# Answer #

You are allowed to conduct hypothetical experiments in survey form, but not directly experiment on the IDP timeline. The survey can ask for quantities relevant to the prescribe questions.
