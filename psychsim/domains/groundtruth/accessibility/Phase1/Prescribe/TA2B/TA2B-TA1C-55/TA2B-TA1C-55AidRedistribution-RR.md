# Sampling strategy #
We would like to sample 10% of the populations, including areas 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. 
For respondents recruited in all areas, recruit the 1st 10 respondents uniformly at random from actors that have used a shelter in the past season. If there is not 10 total, then recruit the remaining at random. Recruit the remaining 6 respondents to be distinct from those already recruited and uniformly at random from those that did not shelter. Include the persistent and unique userID’s for each respondent. Also include in the readme the list of which respondents were former shelterers and which had never sheltered during the past season.
