# Specific question #


We would like to survey data on the current population for the remainder of the current hurricane season and the entirety of the upcoming hurricane season. 


Survey Data: We expect the firm conducting these surveys to use a consistent set of linked participant ID’s. We want the recruitment for these surveys to ask the same participants to fill out surveys to multiple hurricanes as described in Sampling Strategy.


1. EvacSurveyTable: Actor-level survey, conducted on past hurricanes (i.e., asking participants about behaviors in the prior season’s worth of hurricanes):
a. Participant: ID for participant.
b. Hurricane: Identifying the number of hurricane this response pertains to (where 1 is the first hurricane of the first season and you are asking questions about the most recent season).
c. Demographics: gender, age, ethnicity (either majority or minority), religion (either
majority, minority, or none), number of children, wealth (on a 0-5 scale, increasing
from 0 to 5), pet owned or not, fulltime job or not, region of residence
d. Survey questions:
i. MoreGov: I approve of more government involvement in providing assistance to those who have been impacted due to hurricanes. 
(Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)
i. MoreMeansTestedGov: I approve of the government providing assistance to those who have low resources and therefore need it the most. 
(Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)
ii. MoreTaxes: I approve of the government collecting a flat tax on everyone in order to provide more assistance to the regions it generally provides assistance to.
(Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)
iii. MoreTaxesAndMoreDist: I approve of the government collecting a flat tax on everyone in order to provide more assistance to the regions it does not generally provide assistance to.
(Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)
iv. UnequalGov: The government currently creates situations that differentially and unjustly benefits one ethnicity over another.
(Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)
v. UnequalGov: The government currently creates situations that differentially and unjustly benefits one income-class over another.
(Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)
vi. UnequalGov: The government currently creates situations that differentially and unjustly benefits one religion over another.
(Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)
vii. UnequalGov: The government currently creates situations that differentially and unjustly benefits one region over another.
(Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)




# Sampling strategy #


Recruit 10% of the population of Areas 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, to fill out these surveys for the most recent past hurricane season. Include the persistent and unique userID’s for each respondent.
