We assume that this survey is intended to focus on the past and not "the remainder of the current hurricane season and the entirety of the upcoming hurricane season."

1b. We ignored this field, because the survey items were not specific to an individual hurricane. The participants treated the survey items as referring to their current attitudes.

Items 1d.iv-vii were all given the same name in the request. We elaborated on the names as specified in the variable definition file.
