# Specific question #
In the Prescribe questions, the individual prescriptions ask “What should TargetActor do on each day during the new hurricane?” (for the short-term prescription) and “Under what conditions should TargetActor ​evacuate,​ ​shelter​, ​go home​, or stay in current location​?” (for the long-term prescription)


When asking about interventions that are allowed, we learned that no agent can be forced to evacuate or engage in any other behavior. 


Further, since the only metric is “Severity of injury suffered by TargetActor during the hurricane”, it would seem the answer should be to evacuate so as to not suffer any injurious bodily effects of the hurricane. 


Similarly for the long term task, which asks “Under what conditions should TargetActor evacuate, shelter, go home, or stay in current location?” the metric again is “Severity of injury suffered by TargetActor during the hurricane.” For that question is again seems the answer should be that the target actor should evacuate (before landfall of any hurricane) so as to not suffer the injurious bodily effects of any hurricane. 


1. Please confirm that we have interpreted the questions on individual prescription correctly, or, if not, what other constraints exist on the target actor's behavior that would prevent the constant evacuation strategy.
2. Please confirm that, for the other prescription questions, forcing all residents to evacuate is not an allowed option.


# Other applicable details #


# Answer #

1. The constant evacuation strategy is allowed, as the individual prescription is basically "trusted advice" and so will be followed voluntarily by the Target Actor. It is not subject to the same constraints as the other prescriptions, which are implemented by the government. 

2. Correct, the other prescriptions are implemented by the government, which cannot reliably force residents to evacuate.
