# Specific question #
In TA1C-53NewShelters, the column “Condition 2 Satisfaction” has no data for any of the instances. Could TA1C provide the values for that column?

# Answer #

Apologies, that column was inadvertently dropped from the table because the values ended up being identical to those of "Condition 1 Satisfaction" across all instances and participants.
