HoloCane Simulation


# Specific question #

Simulation specifications
We would like to invite subjects to join a HoloCane Simulation. During a 5 day simulation period, we would like to record participants attitudes and interpersonal interactions on each day.
	Please note that only participants invited to the simulation exist in the simulated world. Each instance of the simulated world contains only a 5% sample of the population of the ground-truth instance.

Outset of the simulation

	Part I. Individual
       We assume there is assigned a unique ID (which can be as simple as a participant number) to each HoloCane participant. We will use this unique participant ID to refer to people in our simulation.
       At the beginning of the simulation, we collect the following data from each participant:
1. The following demographic information, along with the date the information was gathered:
a. Age
b. Gender
c. Ethnicity
3. Interpersonal relationships: Describe your relationship with each of the other participants in the simulation (e.g. Upon asking participant 3 his/her relationship to participant 5, the answer is friend. If there are N participants in the simulation, we should get N*(N-1) relationship pairs)
4. On a scale from 0-6 (where 0 is complete disagreement and 6 is complete agreement, describe your willingness to render aid to different relationship types. Provide a rating on this scale for each of the following relationship types: family members, friends, and strangers.

Data Collection During Simulation

Part II: Collect data from the government on crime

1. We want to get a complete crime record, which records the following information for each crime instance:
a. The unique participant ID of the subject who committed each crime
b. The severity of the crime
2. If a human victim is identified for the crime, record their unique participant ID.

# Sampling strategy #

We randomly invite 5% of the population from the simulated world by DARPA, from all instances in Phase I and Phase II.
