# Specific question #

* Is it possible to get information on victims of crime in a Holocane simulation?
* Is it possible to get information on severity of crimes in a Holocane simulation?
* No one seems to receive any aid within HoloCane simulations (as observed in TA2A-TA1C-RR-0382), although people within the HoloCane simulation are observed to give aid to friends. Is this true, and if so, are people giving aid to people outside of the simulation?
* To what extent are we able to specify government policy in a HoloCane simulation. Specifically, are we able to specify policies regarding shelters or taxation?
* Was it your intent that the Target actor not be identifiable via the IDP?

# Other applicable details #


# Answer # 

* No, there are no data available on the victims or severity of crimes.

* Aid distribution outside the simulation is accessible via research request.

* Yes, you can specify shelter and taxation policies for a HoloCane simulation.

* The TargetActor variable is specified as a record in the RunDataTable (the Timestep and EntityIdx indicate the survey participant).
