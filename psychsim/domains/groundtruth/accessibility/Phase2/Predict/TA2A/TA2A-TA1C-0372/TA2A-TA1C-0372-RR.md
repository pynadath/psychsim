# Specific question #

Simulation specifications
	We would like to invite subjects to join a HoloCane Simulation. During a 5 day simulation period, we would like to record participants’ attitudes and interpersonal interactions on each day.
	Please note that only participants invited to the simulation exist in the simulated world. Each instance of the simulated world contains only a 5% sample of the population of the ground-truth instance.

Outset of the simulation

	Part I. Individual 
       We assume there is assigned a unique ID (which can be as simple as a participant number) to each HoloCane participant. We will use this unique participant ID to refer to people in our simulation.
       At the beginning of the simulation, we collect the following data from each participant:
1. The following demographic information, along with the date the information was gathered:
a. Age
b. Gender
c. Ethnicity
2. Interpersonal relationships: Describe your relationship with each of the other participants in the simulation (e.g. Upon asking participant 3 his/her relationship to participant 5, the answer is friend. If there are N participants in the simulation, we should get N*(N-1) relationship pairs)
3. On a scale from 0-6 (where 0 is complete disagreement and 6 is complete agreement, describe your willingness to render aid to different relationship types. Provide a rating on this scale for each of the following relationship types: family members, friends, and strangers.

Data Collection During Simulation 

Part II: Collect data from individual participants

On each day of the simulation, record the following information for each participant

1. Whether the individual i has an injury due to the hurricane (minor or serious, so the set of possible responses would be ‘Minor injury’/’Serious Injury’/’None’ on that day).
2. If the individual i received information about the hurricane from other simulation participants, list the participant IDs of those who provided information to i.
3. If the individual i was rendered aid by other simulation participants, the participant IDs of those who provided aid to i.


# Sampling strategy #
We randomly invite 5% of the population from the simulated world by DARPA, from all instances in Phase I and Phase II.
