# Research method category #

Interview with Government Officials

# Specific question #

* Do you have a progressive tax structure (where individuals who have higher income are taxed more)? If so, what is the tax structure stratified by income?
* Please give us a list of total tax received on each day, for each region (level 0-6, with 0 for no tax, 6 for the maximum possible tax)
* Please give us a list of the amount of aid you send to each region on each day (level 0-6, with 0 for no tax, and 6 for maximal possible tax)
* Please give us a list of the aid budget on each day, for each region. By aid budget, we mean the following: we assume that aid for a given region is limited in some way, so if the aid budget is exhausted for one region, that region cannot receive any further aid until the budget increases. (level 0-6, 0 for no tax, 6 for maximal possible tax).
* What are the expected impacts of aid? For example, is aid used to improve infrastructure in a way that makes an afflicted region more resistant to future hurricanes?
