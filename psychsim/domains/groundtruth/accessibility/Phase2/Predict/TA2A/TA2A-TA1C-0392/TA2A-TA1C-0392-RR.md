Simulation specifications
	We would like to invite subjects to join a HoloCane Simulation. During a 5 day simulation period, we would like to record participants’ attitudes and interpersonal interactions on each day. We would like to specify the intensity of the hurricane as a Category 5 storm, which hits all regions equally on each day of the 5-day simulation period.
	Each instance of the simulated world contains only a 5% sample of the population of the ground-truth instance. This sample should be representative along a balanced set of demographic characteristics: age, gender, ethnicity, pet/no pet, employment status, religion, and region of residency.
	We would like participant IDs to correspond to those in the HoloCane simulation associated with research request TA2A-TA1C-0372-RR, i.e. a given individual i would have the same participant ID in that simulation and in this one.

Outset of the simulation

	Part I. Individual 
       We assume there is assigned a unique ID (which can be as simple as a participant number) to each HoloCane participant. We will use this unique participant ID to refer to people in our simulation.
       At the beginning of the simulation, we collect the following data from each participant:
1. Demographic information, and the date when that information is reported, as follows:
a. Age
b. Gender
2. Reported dissatisfaction (on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is the lowest score and 6 is the highest)
3. Reported eagerness for government aid (i.e. the individual’s aid requirement level) on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is the least eager and 6 is the most

Data collection during simulation

Part I: Collect data from individual participants

On each day of the simulation, record the following information for each participant

1. Individual’s location on that day (e.g. shelter, evacuation)
2. Injury possibility
a. For any individual i who has an injury due to the hurricane, report the severity: (minor or serious, so the response would be ‘Minor Injury’/’Serious Injury’)
b. For any individual i who doesn’t have an injury, report the perceived possibility of injury in the future. For each such individual i, provide a rating of perceived injury possibility on a scale from 0-6 for both of the following injury types: Minor Injury, Serious Injury.
3. Receiving government aid: For each individual i, report whether they received government aid on the current day (Yes/No). Also for each individual i, report the perception of adequateness of government aid on a scale from 0-6 (where 0 is completely inadequate, and 6 is completely adequate.




# Sampling strategy #

We randomly invite 5% of the population from the simulated world by DARPA, from all instances in Phase I and Phase II.
	(We have 4 questions (with two sub-parts within the first question) at the outset of the simulation (Part I), and 6 questions (with two sub-parts within question 2.b and two sub-parts within question 3) for individual participants during each day of the simulation (Part II), all of which sum up to 10.)
