For the Predict instances, we run a HoloCane simulation over the last 5 days of the IDP timeline.

A hurricane cannot equally hit all regions. We provide the hurricane trajectory experienced in the HoloCane within the InstanceVariableTable.

The participants and their IDs are reused from request TA2A-TA1C-0372.
