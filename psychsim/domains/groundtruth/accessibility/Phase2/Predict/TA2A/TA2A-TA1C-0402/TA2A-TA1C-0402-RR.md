# Specific question #

We will send researchers to live with some people in the world, and record their actions on each day.

Before we start, record some background information of the people our researchers live with

1. For net change, the range is -5 to 5, with negative values indicating a decrease, positive values indicating an increase, and 0 for no change. The level should be calibrated to reflect the minimal observed change. If A’s wealth is 4 on day 1, and 4 on day 2, but A’s wealth does increase a little (although the amount is too small to be reflected in wealth level), the net wealth change variable should represent the change as +n for some nonzero n. If the net change level is 0, list ‘no change at all.’
a. Net wealth change level comparing with the last day. (-5 to 5)
b. Net dissatisfaction change level comparing with the last day. (-5 to 5)
c. Net perceived risk change level comparing with the last day. (-5 to 5)
d. Net perceived injury possibility change level comparing with the last day. (-5 to 5)
3. Ask the following questions to individual respondents:
a. I should receive government aid if I suffer wealth loss (Yes / No)
b. I think I’m vulnerable to hurricanes (Yes / No)
c. I’m willing to stay at home (no shelter or evacuation) during a hurricane (Yes / No)
3. Wealth
 . Did your wealth ever decrease due to hurricane strike (only refer to the wealth decrease caused directly by hurricane (e.g. damage of property), answer ‘no’ if has experienced wealth decrease, but not caused by hurricane strike, ‘NA’ if has experienced no wealth decrease)
a. Did your wealth ever decrease due to the cost for treating serious injuries (get seriously injured and pay for the treatment cost, answer ‘no’ if the individual has experienced wealth decrease, but not caused by serious injury cost, and ‘NA’ if the individual has experienced no wealth decrease)	
b. Did your wealth ever decrease due to the cost for treating minor injuries? (get minor injury and pay for the treatment cost, answer ‘no’ if has experienced wealth decrease, but not caused by minor injury cost, ‘NA’ if the individual has experienced no wealth decrease)
