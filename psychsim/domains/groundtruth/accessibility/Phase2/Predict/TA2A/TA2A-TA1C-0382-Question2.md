# Specific question #

The identity of the Target Actor described in the Predict Phase Challenge Description seems to not have been revealed in the IDPs for this phase. Where or how might we be able to find the identity of the Target Actor?

# Answer # 

We have now provided a FAQ to assist with the Predict IDP encoding, but the answer is that the target actor is provided as an entry (should be the last one) in the RunDataTable, with the variable "TargetActor". The Timestep and EntityIdx values in this entry match the post-hurricane participant to be predicted.
