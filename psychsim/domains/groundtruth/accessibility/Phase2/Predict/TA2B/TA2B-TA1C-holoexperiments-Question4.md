# Specific question #


We would like to run a series of holocane experiments, as described below. Please advise which of these would be allowable as currently written. 
For those experiments deemed impermissible, please provide a breakdown of which aspects of the experiment are not allowed and why, and suggest alterations that would be permissible. 


Experiment 1:


Recruit two groups of participants uniformly at random (please recruit the maximum allowed, so that if everyone in the society can be recruited recruit everyone and then split into two equal-sized groups).


For Group 0, have them experience a season of hurricanes in the holocane with no changes to the current rules aid distribution policy.


For Group 1, have them experience a season of hurricanes in the holocane and in the holocane environment aid from the government is doubled in quantity (but is distributed according to the current region preferences of the current government). 


Please have all agents complete the following survey after every hurricane:


Survey the groups:
At the beginning of the season:
Q1 I expect the government to have enough resources to aid those who suffer the ill effects of hurricanes in the upcoming season (1-5, 1 is Strongly Disagree, 5 is Strongly Agree)
Q2 I expect the government to effectively use the resources it has to aid those who suffer the ill effects of hurricanes in the upcoming season (1-5, 1 is Strongly Disagree, 5 is Strongly Agree)
Q3 I expect the government to have enough resources to assist efforts to evacuate or shelter from hurricanes in the upcoming season (1-5, 1 is Strongly Disagree, 5 is Strongly Agree)
Q4 I expect the government to effectively use the resources it has to assist efforts to evacuate or shelter from hurricanes in the upcoming season (1-5, 1 is Strongly Disagree, 5 is Strongly Agree)
Q5 I would be willing to contribute some of my wealth to the government’s resource pool to be used in assistance to others in evacuating, sheltering, or otherwise avoiding ill effects of hurricanes in the upcoming season (1-5, 1 is Strongly Disagree, 5 is Strongly Agree)


At the end of the season:
Q1 I feel the government had enough resources to aid those who suffer the ill effects of hurricanes in the previous season (1-5, 1 is Strongly Disagree, 5 is Strongly Agree)
Q2 I feel the government effectively used the resources it had to aid those who suffer the ill effects of hurricanes in the previous season (1-5, 1 is Strongly Disagree, 5 is Strongly Agree)
Q3 I feel the government had enough resources to assist efforts to evacuate or shelter from hurricanes in the previous season (1-5, 1 is Strongly Disagree, 5 is Strongly Agree)
Q4 I feel the government effectively used the resources it had to assist efforts to evacuate or shelter from hurricanes in the previous season (1-5, 1 is Strongly Disagree, 5 is Strongly Agree)
Q5 I would be willing to contribute to the government’s resource pool to be used in assistance to others in evacuating, sheltering, or otherwise avoiding ill effects of hurricanes in future seasons (1-5, 1 is Strongly Disagree, 5 is Strongly Agree)




Experiment 2


Recruit two groups of participants uniformly at random (please recruit the maximum allowed, so that if everyone in the society can be recruited recruit everyone and then split into two equal-sized groups).


For Group 0, have them experience a season of hurricanes in the holocane with no changes to the current rules tax policy.


For Group 1, have them experience a season of hurricanes in the holocane and in the holocane environment the participants experience a one-time tax of 20% of their starting wealth. They experience no other changes in government policy aside from this initial tax. 


Please have all agents complete the following survey after every hurricane:

At the beginning of the season:
Q1 I expect the government to have enough resources to aid those who suffer the ill effects of hurricanes in the upcoming season (1-5, 1 is Strongly Disagree, 5 is Strongly Agree)

Experiment 3:


Recruit two groups of participants uniformly at random (please recruit the maximum allowed, so that if everyone in the society can be recruited, recruit everyone and then split into two equal-sized groups).


For Group 0, have them experience a season of hurricanes in the holocane with no changes to the current rules for sheltering, evacuating, and staying at home.


For Group 1, have them experience a season of hurricanes in the holocane where shelters are not available in the holocane environment. 


Please have all agents complete the following survey after every hurricane:


1. Hurricane Number
2. At shelter: Did you stay at a public shelter at any point during the last
hurricane?
3. Evacuated: Did you stay outside the area at any point during the last
hurricane?
4. Injured: Were you injured at any point during the last hurricane?
5. Risk: The last hurricane posed a significant risk to myself and my family.
(Response on a 1-7 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly
agree”)
6. RiskIfStayAtHome: If you were to stay at home for a hurricane similar to the one you just experienced, rate how much you agree with the following: “The last hurricane posed a significant risk to myself and my family.”
(Response on a 1-7 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)
7. Dissatisfaction: The government response to the last hurricane was unfair
and inadequate. (Response on a 1-7 scale, ranging from “strongly
disagree” to “strongly agree”)
8. Shelter possibility: I considered moving to a public shelter during the last hurricane. (Response on a 1-7 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)
9. Evacuation possibility: I considered evacuating the area during the last hurricane. (Response on a 1-7 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)
10. Stay at home possibility: I considered staying at home throughout the last hurricane. (Response on a 1-7 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)


# Other applicable details #


For the 1st experiment, we are asking for an experiment where the amount of aid is increased. We are asking because we currently completely lack any observational data of such a condition and the predict questions are asking for predictions of what will happen if aid were increased. We need experimental or observational data on which to base a prediction. We believe this is within the rules because we are asking for a recruited group to experience simulated hurricanes for a full season in the Holocane environment and those particular hurricanes need not be the same as the one that we are being asked about in the predict question. Also, we are not asking for the taxes to be levied at the same time as aid is being increased, as the predict question asks.


For the 2nd experiment, we are asking for an experiment where a tax is levied. We are asking because we currently completely lack any observational data of such a condition and the predict questions are asking for predictions of what will happen if taxes were collected. We need experimental or observational data on which to base a prediction. We believe this is within the rules because we are asking for a recruited group to experience simulated hurricanes for a full season in the Holocane environment and those particular hurricanes need not be the same as the one that we are being asked about in the predict question. Also, we are not asking for aid to be increased at the same time as taxes are collected, as the predict question asks.


For the 3rd experiment, we are asking for an experiment where shelters are no longer an option. We are asking because we currently completely lack any observational data of such a condition and since the predict questions are asking for predictions of what will happen if shelters were closed, we need some sort of experimental or observational data on which to base an answer. We believe this is within the rules because we are asking for a recruited group to experience simulated hurricanes for a full season in the Holocane environment and those particular hurricanes need not be the same as the one that we are being asked about in the predict question.






# Answer #

These are allowable as is for the Phase 2 Explain instances. They are allowable on a reduced timeline for the Phase 2 Predict instances, namely as a replay of the days corresponding to the last hurricane in the IDP timeline (the same hurricane characteristics are not guaranteed, unless requested).
