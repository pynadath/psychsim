# Specific question #


This is a follow-up question related to the previous ambiguousIDs report. We would like to request that the IDs returned to us in the already pending requests, 12PairedPosthurricaneSurveys and 13PairedPrehurricaneSurveys, be reassigned to be unique across both all hurricanes/surveys and respondents. That is to say, we would ask that the participant identifiers returned with those surveys be global unique identifiers that are consistent within each instance across space and time. We would like the ability to submit future requests in relation to these global identifiers as well. 


1. Would it be possible to obtain these global unique identifiers for the existing RR12 and RR13 requests?


2. In a future request, if we asked for unique global identifiers for death reports that are also linked to the unique global identifiers of the paired requests, would we be able to obtain these?


# Other applicable details #




# Answer #

1. Yes.

2. Yes. It would be helpful if the request specified what value should be given in case an actor died before ever participating in the surveys.
