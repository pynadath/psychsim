# Sampling strategy #
  
Please provide this data for all agents from RR14deathandaidPt1

# Other applicable detail #
Please provide this data for all agents who died in instances 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19.  

Give all of these agents unique IDs in the following way: An example name is D112-1, where D stands for died, 112 stands for died on date 112, -1 means they are the 1st person to die that day (another example, D43-5 would be the 5th person to die on day 43).   


For instances 15, 16 and 17, provide additional tables that map the above decedentID to the pre-hurricane survey respondent number or the post-hurricane survey respondent number in the cases where the decedent had filled a pre or post survey for the 2PairedPredictSurveys-RR. You can put these mappings in a relationshipdatatable mapping decedentID to “ActorPre 0” for example.  


For instances 18 and 19, provide additional tables that map the above decedentID to the pre-hurricane survey respondent number or the post-hurricane survey respondent IDs that are used in the 12PairedPosthurricaneSurveys-RR and 13PairedPrehurricaneSurveys-RR in the cases where the decedent had filled pre or post surveys. You can put these mappings in a relationshipdatatable mapping decedentID to the “ActorPre 1 Hurricane 1” for example.
