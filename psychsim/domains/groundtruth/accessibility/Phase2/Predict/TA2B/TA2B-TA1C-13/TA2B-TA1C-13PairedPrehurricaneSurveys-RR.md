# Research method category #
Survey


# Specific question #
We would like to collect the pre-hurricane surveys on the same participants as were included in the Predict IDP, but asking each participant to fill out one additional pre-hurricane survey for the hurricane that occurred directly after the one that they already filled. We call this a paired survey because we are seeking responses that relate to adjacent hurricanes. 


Survey Data: We expect the firm conducting the pre- and post- hurricane surveys to use the same set of linked participant IDs as are in the IDP. 


4. ActorPreTable: Actor-level survey, conducted when a hurricane is approaching:
a. Participant: ID for participant.
b. Hurricane: Identifying number of hurricane (see numbering notes in HurricaneTable).
d. Survey questions:
i. At Shelter: Are you currently staying at a public shelter?
ii. Evacuated: Are you currently residing outside the area?
iii. Anticipated Shelter: (If answer to i. is “no”) I expect to go to a public
shelter during the approaching hurricane. (Response on a 1-7 scale,
ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)
iv. Anticipated Evacuation: (If answer to ii. is “no”) I expect to evacuate the
area during the approaching hurricane. (Response on a 1-7 scale, ranging
from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)
v. Category: What category do you think the approaching hurricane is?
(Response on the same 1-5 scale as 6.b)
vi. Risk: I expect the approaching hurricane to pose a significant risk to my
family and me. (Response on a 1-7 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree”
to “strongly agree”)


# Sampling strategy #


Recruit the same participants as those that responded to pre-hurricane surveys in the IDP. For each recruit, have them fill a pre-hurricane survey for the next hurricane that occurs in the season. We call this a paired survey because we are seeking responses that relate to adjacent hurricanes.
