# Specific question #


Q1. 
In each of the experiment requests (RR’s numbered 16, 17 and 18), we took the advice of “” and requested: 
“have Conditions 0 and 1 both involve experiencing just a simulation of the last hurricane of the IDP, matched to the characteristics of that last hurricane. “


We wanted to clarify that the holocane experiment we just received, 16aidincreasetest, the hurricane details of the hurricane that participants experienced in Instance 18 (both condition 0 and condition 1) corresponds to Hurricane number 6 from the IDP for that area. 


We want to also clarify that the hurricane details for the hurricane that participants experienced in Instance 19 (both conditions) corresponds to the details of Hurricane number 10 in the IDP. 


Please confirm if we are interpreting things right with respect to what was done in the experiment 16aidincreasetest. If so, are the timesteps provided in the dataset matched to the past timesteps of the last hurricane, or do we need to request a new hurricane table? If the details do not match the last hurricane, what were those hurricane details? 


Q2. 
Are there any situations in which we can recruit the same participants to experience multiple holocane experiments? Would we be restricted to the number of hurricanes that could be run in each sesion? Should we request to smush both condition tests into a single session. How can we get the same people to experience multiple conditions and report on both?


# Other applicable details #


# Answer #

Q1. Yes, the identical hurricane timeline for those hurricanes was simulated within the HoloCane.

Q2. We're not sure what is being asked, as the same people did experience multiple conditions as requested in 16aidincreasetest. There is no restriction on the number of hurricanes for the Explain instances. However, for the Predict instances, the timeline cannot extend into the timeline to be predicted.
