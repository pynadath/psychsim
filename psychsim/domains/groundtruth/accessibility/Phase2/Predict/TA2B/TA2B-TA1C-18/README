We provide the matching pre/post-survey participant IDs as in previous requests.

We interpreted requests for a 5-point scale as errors and used 7-point scales instead. If a 5-point scale was actually intended, we can provide the equivalent 5-point values in a revised data set.

Actors can answer questions about only those friends who were also participating in the experiment.
