Experiment


# Specific question #


We would like to submit the following holocane experiment.


Recruit the largest groups of participants possible uniformly at random. Please recruit the maximum allowed, so that if everyone in the society can be recruited recruit everyone.


For Condition 0, have them experience a season of hurricanes in the holocane with no changes to the current tax policy.

For Condition 1, have them experience a season of hurricanes in the holocane and in the holocane environment the participants experience a one-time tax of 20% of their starting wealth. They experience no other changes in government policy aside from this initial tax. 


Demographics Data Collection:
For each agent, upon enrollment, please provide all IDP demographic data; including, gender, age, ethnicity, religion, number of dependents, wealth (on a 0-7 scale), pet owned, full time job, and region of residence, number of friends. 


# Sampling strategy #
Please recruit the largest sample allowable. 
If it is possible, please have the same recruited participants first experience the Condition 0 hurricane experiment and then after an adequate rest experience the Condition 1 hurricane experiment. If it is not possible to have the participants perform two holocane experiments, then split the participant pool equally and at random into two equal sized groups. Identify all recruited participants with unique identifiers. 


For Instances 15, 16 and 17, have Conditions 0 and 1 both involve experiencing an entire simulated hurricane season. 


For Instances 18 and 19, have Conditions 0 and 1 both involve experiencing just a simulation of the last hurricane of the IDP, matched to the characteristics of that last hurricane. 


For instances 15, 16 and 17, provide additional tables that map the agentID to the pre-hurricane survey respondent number or the post-hurricane survey respondent number in the cases where the agent had filled a pre or post survey for the 2PairedPredictSurveys-RR. You can put these mappings in a relationshipdatatable mapping decedentID to “ActorPre 0”, for example.


For instances 18 and 19, provide additional tables that map the above agentID to the pre-hurricane survey respondent number or the post-hurricane survey respondent IDs that are used in the 12PairedPosthurricaneSurveys-RR and 13PairedPrehurricaneSurveys-RR in the cases where the agent had filled pre or post surveys. You can put these mappings in a relationshipdatatable mapping decedentID to the “ActorPre 1 Hurricane 1”, for example.


# Other applicable detail #


This request has been split into 3 parts to accommodate the 10 question per RR limit. All 3 RR’s involve the same exact experiment that is run on a pool of participants. The first RR asked for the post hurricane surveys collected while the participants are in the holocane. This RR asks for the demographics characteristics of those same participants. The third RR asks for the pre-hurricane surveys collected while those participants were in the holocane simulation. Please note that, if possible, we had requested the same participants be allowed to experience the control condition holocane and then the experimental condition holocane. If multiple holocane exposures are not allowed on the same participants, then split into two groups.
