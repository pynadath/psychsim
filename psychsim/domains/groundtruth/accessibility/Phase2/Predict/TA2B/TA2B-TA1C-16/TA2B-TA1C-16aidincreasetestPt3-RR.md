# Specific question #


We would like to submit the following holocane experiment.


Recruit the largest groups of participants possible uniformly at random. Please recruit the maximum allowed, so that if everyone in the society can be recruited recruit everyone.


For Condition 0, have them experience a season of hurricanes in the holocane with no changes to the current rules aid distribution policy.


For Condition 1, have them experience a season of hurricanes in the holocane and in the holocane environment aid from the government is doubled in quantity (but is distributed according to the current region preferences of the current government). 


Presurvey, Please have all agents complete the following survey before every hurricane:
Q1. Rate how satisfied you are currently with the government, (1-5, 1 is Strongly Dissatisfied, 5 is Strongly Satisfied)
Q2. Risk: I expect the approaching hurricane to pose a significant risk to my family and me. (Response on a 1-7 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)
Q3. Shelter possibility: I am considering moving to a public shelter during upcoming hurricane. (Response on a 1-7 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)
Q4. Evacuation possibility: (If answer to ii. is “no”) I am considering evacuating the area during the upcoming hurricane. (Response on a 1-7 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)
Q5. Stay at home possibility: I am considering staying at home throughout the upcoming hurricane. (Response on a 1-7 scale, ranging from “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree”)
Q6. Are you or your dependents currently injured? (Answer with ‘self’ if just you are injured. Answer with ‘selfplusdependents’ if you and your dependents are injured. Answer with ‘dependents’ if just your dependents are injured. Answer with ‘none’ if none applies.)
Q7. How many days did you stay at a public shelter during the previous Hurricane?
Q8. How many days were you evacuated from the area during the previous hurricane?
Q9. What is your current wealth? (Either give a value or rate on a scale from 0 to 7)
Q10. In the previous hurricane, did your primary residence suffer significant property damage? (Response on a 1-5 scale, ranging from "strongly disagree"  to "strongly agree" )


# Sampling strategy #


Please recruit the largest sample allowable. 
If it is possible, please have the same recruited participants first experience the Condition 0 hurricane experiment and then after an adequate rest experience the Condition 1 hurricane experiment. If it is not possible to have the participants perform two holocane experiments, then split the participant pool equally and at random into two equal sized groups. Identify all recruited participants with unique identifiers. 


For Instances 15, 16 and 17, have Conditions 0 and 1 both involve experiencing an entire simulated hurricane season. 


For Instances 18 and 19, have Conditions 0 and 1 both involve experiencing just a simulation of the last hurricane of the IDP, matched to the characteristics of that last hurricane. 


For instances 15, 16 and 17, provide additional tables that map the agentID to the pre-hurricane survey respondent number or the post-hurricane survey respondent number in the cases where the agent had filled a pre or post survey for the 2PairedPredictSurveys-RR. You can put these mappings in a relationshipdatatable mapping decedentID to “ActorPre 0”, for example.


For instances 18 and 19, provide additional tables that map the above agentID to the pre-hurricane survey respondent number or the post-hurricane survey respondent IDs that are used in the 12PairedPosthurricaneSurveys-RR and 13PairedPrehurricaneSurveys-RR in the cases where the agent had filled pre or post surveys. You can put these mappings in a relationshipdatatable mapping decedentID to the “ActorPre 1 Hurricane 1”, for example.


# Other applicable detail #


This request has been split into 3 parts to accommodate the 10 question per RR limit. All 3 RR’s involve the same exact experiment that is run on a pool of participants. The first RR asked for the post hurricane surveys collected while the participants are in the holocane. The second RR asked for the demographics characteristics of those same participants. This RR asks for the pre-hurricane surveys collected while those participants were in the holocane simulation. Please note that, if possible, we had requested the same participants be allowed to experience the control condition holocane and then the experimental condition holocane. If multiple holocane exposures are not allowed on the same participants, then split into two groups.
