# Specific question #
In TA2A-TA1C-0032-RR of Phase I, for people’s answer to question 17
How many of your acquaintances got injured this hurricane season
We want to know:
1. What does ‘acquaintances’ mean in this case, is it:
a. People one person knows and lives in the same region as this person, (and this person may provide aid to them or receive aid from them, same as the term ‘acquaintances’ used later)
b. People one person knows and live in different regions as this person, (and this person may exchange information on hurricane category with them, same as the term ‘friends’ used later)
c. The sum of ‘friends’ and ‘acquaintances’
d. Others, please specify
2. We want to make sure people answer this question based only on the information they know, is that so?(If people don’t know the number of acquaintances injured, they should say ‘NAN’, since they have reported a number, we assume people must know the number of injured acquaintances somehow, is that correct?)
