# Research method category #

Interview with government officials

# Specific question #

We want to have a full list about what the government did beforehand, in response to a hurricane(e.g. Measures, Policies, etc). For each measure/policy, it should include:
1.  What action the government took(a description, or detailed data, if applicable, like if it’s about government aid, it should provide data on where were those aid sent to on each day, and a description on the type of aid and financial value, if applicable)
2. Effects of those measures/policies and the goal for taking those actions/setting up those policies.

	Based on the information we have received, the answer to this question should at least include:
a. Government’s aid
b. Government’s hurricane prediction
c. Shelter Policy
d. Spread information via government broadcast(when, which information do they spread, etc)
	And government should specify other actions/policies as well.
