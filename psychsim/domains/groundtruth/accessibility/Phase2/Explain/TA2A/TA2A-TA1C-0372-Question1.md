# Specific question #

Which Hurricane generation parameters can we specify within the HoloCane simulation? Can we specify the intensity/location of the hurricane? If not, can we specify how the hurricane is generated? E.g., if it is generated according to a Poisson distribution, can we specify the shape parameter lambda??

For the Explain instances, you can specify intensity/location for a given day or time series, as desired. For the Predict instances, you can do the same, but for only a timeline covered in the IDP (i.e., not over the future timeline to be predicted).
