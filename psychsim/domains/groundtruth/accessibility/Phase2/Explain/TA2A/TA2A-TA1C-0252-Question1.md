# Specific question #
        First of all, we want to clarify that this is for the RR sequence number 0252 we proposed, although in the data we receive, the tsv file name is 0272.
1. In data for RR0192, we know for instance 1, a person from Region01, aging 74, with minority ethnicity has 0 friend living in region01, 0 friend living out of region01, but in 0252, this same person reports to have 2 friends living out of region01, and 0 friend living in region01. We want to know
   1. When did 00192 survey and 0252 survey being conducted respectively?
   2. If it’s not a mistake in either of the file, can we interpret it as this person initially has some friend/or initially has no friends, but loses them/ gets new friends later?
        (Actually there are more contradiction between the data we received now and the previous data, for example, a person from region02, aging 25 reported to have 1 friend in total, but this person reports to have 0 friend living in region02, and 0 friend living out of region02, which cannot sum up to 1 friend.
   2. For the answers to questions ‘Know something from social media’(e.g. Do you know whether friends are injured from social media?) We want to know whether ‘from social media’ includes interaction with friends in social media (in that case, anything people know from friends will also be counted as know from social media; we would hope it not, as we have a question asking ‘Know something from friends’)
   3. We want to make sure the data provided in RR0232 is correct, as in RR0252, it’s obvious that people have a tendency to give aid to people with similar demography; however, this tendency doesn’t exist based on answers for RR0232(e.g. The person answers to RR0232, from region01 and with minority religion, have a level 6 willingness to give aid to people of majority religion, but only level 2 willingness to give aid to people of minority religion; similar instance never appears in RR0252 but appear many times in RR0232)

# Other applicable details #

1. Our Phase 2 responses have inaccurate friend/acquaintance counts for Instance 1. We apologize for the error, and we will send corrected tables for the Instance 1 data (affected fields are "Out Friends", "In Friends", and "Acquaintances").

2. Yes, participants did count social media messages from friends as falling into both categories of sources.

3. Yes, the data are correct. Actors are interpreting this question slightly differently in Phase 2 so as to be more informative.
