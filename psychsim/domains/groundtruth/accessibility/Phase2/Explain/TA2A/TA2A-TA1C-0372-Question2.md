# Specific question #

Is there any way to link participant IDs within a HoloCane simulation to the participant IDs outside the HoloCane simulation? Are HoloCane IDs generated from regular participant IDs?


# Other applicable details #


# Answer # 

The participant IDs for each survey/experiment are generated independently from those of others, unless otherwise specified in the request.
