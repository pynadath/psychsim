# Specific question #

We want to ask the following questions regarding RR0272:
What’s the definition of variable ‘Timestep’. If it’s the last timestep for this person to commit a crime, can we be sure that from this timestep to the timestep when this report is generated, this person never commits any crime? For anyone whose name is not on the list, can we also be sure that he/she never commits any crime from timestep 1 to when this report is generated.
When is the report generated for each instance (so that we can know we don’t have information after this timestep)

# Other applicable details #

# Answer #

The report is generated at the end of the IDP time period, and yes, the report is complete.
