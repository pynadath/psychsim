# Specific question #
We want to confirm whether the ground truth is same between Phase I and II, specifically whether the following two components are true:
1. All rules/relationships existing in Phase I will also apply to Phase II.
2. All rules/relationships not existing in Phase II also don’t exist.
Also we want to know something about the RR sampling. Namely:
   3. Can we sample/do research in instances of Phase I? If so, can one RR sample from all instances in Phase I and II? (e.g. Do a survey and sample 10% of the population in all instances of 3 tasks of Phase I, and all instances in Phase II)

# Answer # 

The ground truth is similar between Phases 1 and 2, but may not be exactly the same; assumptions should be tested.
