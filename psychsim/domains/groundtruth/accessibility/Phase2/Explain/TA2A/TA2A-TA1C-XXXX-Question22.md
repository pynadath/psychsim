# Specific question #

We want to ask the following questions:
How can we use HoloCane? As stated in initial guidance ‘ The HoloCane® places subjects within a hyper-compressed hurricane timeline of the experimenter’s choosing’. Does that mean that we should choose a period of time that has passed (maybe the most recent hurricane in this hurricane season), or that we should choose a period of time in the future (the approaching hurricane)? What’s the longest period of HoloCane experiment? What is the maximum amount of people participating in HoloCane experiment in one RR?
User case clarification(In the following cases, we are talking about a world with 160 people as overall population)
Is it possible that we invite 10 people to join HoloCane simulation, and we let HoloCane automatically simulate the behaviors of other people and government (work as NPC in the game), and we can be sure that the behaviors of those NPC individuals and government is generated the same way as they are generated in the ‘actual simulated world’?
Is it possible that we invite 10 people to join HoloCane simulation, and we only let HoloCane automatically simulate government actions (even if we don’t know what actions government can do) or part of government actions (we will specify what action), and make the machine ignore the rest of people in the world. (So essentially we are dealing with a world with only 10 people, not 160 people)
Can we ask a detailed description of all government’s current actions/policies/measures responding to hurricane in a new RR? We know we cannot do that in Phase I, but in Phase II, we know government are ‘hiring us’ to help produce better policies, we think government might want to share their current actions/policies with us.
As stated in initial data description: ‘so you also have a team of observers ready to give you first-hand reports of conditions and behavior on the ground’. Does that mean that we can ‘insert our researchers’ into a hurricane world, and the things they know on the field (information they get from social media, government broadcast, and their observation) will be very similar to what normal individuals heard/witnessed?
We also want to ask a follow-up question based on our previous clarification question: We know there might be some new variables in Phase II, we want to further ask those questions:
All variables have been confirmed on their existence, is it possible that they will disappear? And for all constant variables (variables that don’t change over time) in Phase I, will their value change in Phase II? (E.g. If someone’s evacuation attitude doesn’t change in Phase I, and we already know the value, I hope we don’t need to ask for that value again in Phase II)
All relationships among variables that exist in Phase I, will they disappear? Or change in any ways?

# Answer #

Questions aren't numbered, so we repeat them here, with answers below:

"How can we use HoloCane? As stated in initial guidance ‘ The HoloCane® places subjects within a hyper-compressed hurricane timeline of the experimenter’s choosing’. Does that mean that we should choose a period of time that has passed (maybe the most recent hurricane in this hurricane season), or that we should choose a period of time in the future (the approaching hurricane)? What’s the longest period of HoloCane experiment? What is the maximum amount of people participating in HoloCane experiment in one RR?"

HoloCane would be over a timeline into the future, starting from the current day. The longest period is one season. The maximum people for a single RR would be 5% of the population.

"Is it possible that we invite 10 people to join HoloCane simulation, and we let HoloCane automatically simulate the behaviors of other people and government (work as NPC in the game), and we can be sure that the behaviors of those NPC individuals and government is generated the same way as they are generated in the ‘actual simulated world’?"

The behaviors will be generated the same way in the HoloCane as in the real world, but as with all laboratory experiments, not all real-world factors will be be included in the HoloCane simulation.

"Is it possible that we invite 10 people to join HoloCane simulation, and we only let HoloCane automatically simulate government actions (even if we don’t know what actions government can do) or part of government actions (we will specify what action), and make the machine ignore the rest of people in the world. (So essentially we are dealing with a world with only 10 people, not 160 people)"

Yes, you can manipulate the conditions in that way.

"Can we ask a detailed description of all government’s current actions/policies/measures responding to hurricane in a new RR? We know we cannot do that in Phase I, but in Phase II, we know government are ‘hiring us’ to help produce better policies, we think government might want to share their current actions/policies with us."

You can ask what the government did in the past and what they might do under certain future conditions.

"As stated in initial data description: ‘so you also have a team of observers ready to give you first-hand reports of conditions and behavior on the ground’. Does that mean that we can ‘insert our researchers’ into a hurricane world, and the things they know on the field (information they get from social media, government broadcast, and their observation) will be very similar to what normal individuals heard/witnessed?"

Yes.

"All variables have been confirmed on their existence, is it possible that they will disappear? And for all constant variables (variables that don’t change over time) in Phase I, will their value change in Phase II? (E.g. If someone’s evacuation attitude doesn’t change in Phase I, and we already know the value, I hope we don’t need to ask for that value again in Phase II)"

We cannot answer this directly and refer back to our answer to TA2A-TA1C-XXXX-Question21: The ground truth is similar between Phases 1 and 2, but may not be exactly the same; assumptions should be tested.

"All relationships among variables that exist in Phase I, will they disappear? Or change in any ways?"
