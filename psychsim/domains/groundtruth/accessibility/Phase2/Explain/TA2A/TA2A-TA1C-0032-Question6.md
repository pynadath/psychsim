# Specific question #

We want to confirm the following information:
1. Answers to question 16 and 17 in TA2A-TA1C-0032-RR (The number of family and acquaintances injured) should cover the injury across all 6 hurricanes given by the hurricane table, since we ask for the injury in the hurricane season, is that so?
2. If one person gets injured twice in two hurricanes during this season, will it be counted as one injury or two? (In both questions 16 and 17)
3. The acquaintances injury (answer to question 17) should only include adults, so the person’s own children injury, his friends/acquaintances’ children injury should not be counted, is that so?

# Other applicable details #


# Answer # 

1. Correct.

2. One. The questions ask for the number of people injured, not the number of injuries.

3. Correct.
