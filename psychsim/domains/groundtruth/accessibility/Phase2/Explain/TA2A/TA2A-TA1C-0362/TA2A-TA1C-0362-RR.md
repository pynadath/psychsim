HoloCane Simulation


# Specific question #
We would like to invite subjects to join a HoloCane Simulation. During a 5 day simulation period, we would like to record participants’ attitudes and interpersonal interactions on each day.
	Please note that only participants invited to the simulation exist in the simulated world. Each instance of the simulated world contains only a 5% sample of the population of the ground-truth instance.

Outset of the simulation

	Part I. Individual 
       We assume there is assigned a unique ID (which can be as simple as a participant number) to each HoloCane participant. We will use this unique participant ID to refer to people in our simulation.
       At the beginning of the simulation, we collect the following data from each participant:
1. Demographic information, and the date when that information is reported, as follows:
a. Date
b. Age
c. Gender
d. Ethnicity
e. Pets
f. Full_time_job
g. Religion
h. Residency
2. Reported dissatisfaction (on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is the lowest score and 6 is the highest)
3. Reported eagerness for government aid (i.e. the individual’s aid requirement level) on a scale from 0-6, where 0 is the least eager and 6 is the most

Part II. Government action
		In our simulation, we want the government to do the following things:
1. Predict hurricanes as it does in the simulated instance provided by the DARPA team, and spread (i.e. notify public about) the prediction in the same way as it does in simulated instance provided by the DARPA team.
2. Collect data and calculate the regional damage on a daily basis, and send aid to the region whose regional damage is the highest among all regions.
3. No other actions will be undertaken by the government in our simulation.

Part III. Shelter
		All policies for shelter remain identical to the policies in place on the last day of the instance provided by the DARPA team, and remain unchanged during our simulation period.

Data collection during simulation

Part I: Collect data from individual participants

On each day of the simulation, record the following information for each participant

1. Individual’s location on that day (e.g. shelter, evacuation)
2. Injury possibility
a. For any individual i who has an injury due to the hurricane, report the severity: (minor or serious, so the response would be ‘Minor Injury’/’Serious Injury’)
b. For any individual i who doesn’t have an injury, report the perceived possibility of injury in the future. For each such individual i, provide a rating of perceived injury possibility on a scale from 0-6 for both of the following injury types: Minor Injury, Serious Injury.
3. Receiving government aid: For each individual i, report whether they received government aid on the current day (Yes/No). Also for each individual i, report the perception of adequateness of government aid on a scale from 0-6 (where 0 is completely inadequate, and 6 is completely adequate).
4. Net perceived change in perception
 . For each individual i, report the net perceived change in risk level compared to the previous day, on a scale from (-6 to 6)
a. For each individual i, report the net perceived change in injury possibility compared to the previous day, on a scale from (-6 to 6)

Part II: Collect data from the government

1. We want to get data on government hurricane prediction, specifically:
a. The content of the prediction
b. When the prediction was made
c. When the prediction was propagated, and in what way/which platform
2. For each region on each day, how much did the government spend on aid? If region X did not receive any aid on Day N, report $0 for region X on Day N
3. For each region on each day, was any non-financial aid provided? If non-financial aid was provided, report ‘Yes’ and list the type of non-financial aid that was provided.



# Sampling strategy #
We randomly invite 5% of the population from the simulated world by DARPA, from all instances in Phase I and Phase II.
	(We have 3 questions at the outset of the simulation (Part I), 4 questions for individual participants during each day of the simulation (Part I), and 3 questions collecting data from the government (Part II), all of which sum up to 10.)
