* For net change level, the range is -5 to 5, with negative number being decrease, positive number being increase, 0 for no change; The level should be adjusted to reflect even the minimal possible change. (E.g. If A’s wealth is 4 on day 1, and 4 on day 2, but indeed A’s wealth increase a little (although the amount is too small to be reflected in wealth level), so the net wealth change should be +2 or something like that to represent the change; if the net change level is 0, it must represent ‘no change at all’ )

   2. Net dissatisfaction change level comparing with the last day. (-5 to 5)
