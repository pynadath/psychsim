# Specific question #


We are conducting a randomized controlled trial with 4 total conditions. From the total set of recruited participants split participants into:
Group0 - Control Group
Group1 - No Aid
Group2 - Aid in my region
Group3 - Aid in all regions but mine


Each participant will experience an entire hurricane season in the holocane system (luckily the holocane can conduct such a test very quickly at much faster than real time speeds). 
Each recruited participant will then experience the holocane independently. Their grouping simply refers to which experimental condition they will experience in the holocane. 


Group0 will experience the hurricane season with any changes to their current world. That is, whatever their current government’s policy for distributing aid is, should be replicated in the synthetic holocane experiment. 


Groups 1, 2, and 3 will experience different governmental aid conditions. 


In Group1, all participants will experience hurricanes and no location in their synthetic world will receive any aid. 


In Group2, all participants will experience hurricanes and only the regional location of the participant receives aid from the government. That aid occurs daily regardless of a hurricane being in the region. 


In Group3, all participants will experience hurricanes and all regions except the one that the participant resides in will receive daily aid from the government. 


Data collection:
For each group, we would like to collect their demographics (Age Children Ethnicity Fulltime_Job Gender Pets Religion Residence Income_Level) and a full behavioral record (evacuate, shelter, stay home) for every day in the holocane simulator, plus a full outcome record for the participant (were they “injured” and on which day, did they suffer any loss of income and on which days, did their simulated property get damaged and when and how much cost). We would also like to collect the respondents' daily level of satisfaction with the government. If the holocane simulates government aid responses, then please include the records of where and when aid was given. Also include the data on the simulated hurricanes; i.e. where the hurricane was each day and the category of the storm. 


# Sampling strategy #


Please recruit the largest percentage of the population in each of the 3 explain areas that is allowed uniformly at random from the total population if each. For the recruits from each area, assign each particular recruit alternatively to Group 0, 1, 2, and 3, cycling through that list until all recruits have been assigned into a single experimental condition group.


# Other applicable detail #


If a full hurricane season would result in too long of time spent in the holocane simulator, then please run as long a session as would be allowed and report what fraction of a usual season was simulated.
