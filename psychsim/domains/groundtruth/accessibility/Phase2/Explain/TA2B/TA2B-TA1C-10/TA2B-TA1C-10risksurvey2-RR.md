# Specific question #
We would like to augment the actor post-hurricane survey for by asking each person various questions about actions they could have taken. We request the participant IDs and timesteps for collection match the ones collected previously in RR02PairedPredictSurveys


Please note that questions 1-3 pertain to risk as it relates to risks to the physical health and safety of the respondent and his/her family. Questions 4-6 pertain to risk as it relates to the risk to a household’s property. Questions 7-9 pertain to risk as it relates to the risk to a household’s wealth. Question 10 relates to all possible types of risks and focuses on asking for a measure of risk that is independent of a household’s behavioral choices.
