# Specific question #


According to the simulation description, Risk is on a 1-7 scale with 7 being the "Strongly Agree" with the hurricane posing a significant risk. However, upon basic analysis we've found that Risk is negatively correlated with variables like Anticipated Shelter (approx -0.38) and Anticipated Evacuation (approx -0.93).


Are participants in pre-hurricane surveys reporting their risk conditioned on their expected evacuation/shelter actions. That is, would they potentially say the impending hurricane poses low risk as they are accounting for their plan to evacuate when answering that question? Or, are they describing an absolute level of risk the hurricane poses that is not conditioned on the evacuation/sheltering/stay at home plans of an individual.


Alternatively, is it possible that the questionnaire for Risk is reported on a reverse scale?
