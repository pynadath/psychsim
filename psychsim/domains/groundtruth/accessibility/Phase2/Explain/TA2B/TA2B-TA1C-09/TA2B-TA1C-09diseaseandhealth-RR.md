We request this data be collected for all agents sampled in RR02PairedPredictSurveys, using the same ids, and on the same time-steps as the IDP and PairedSurveys.  


# Other applicable detail #
For question 5, if you would be better off interpreting this as a fully open-ended question where participants simply volunteer nature of their compromised health circumstances, please do just elicit those open-ended responses. We provide checkboxes merely to help elicit sufficient detail in response, but will accept whatever level of detail is reportable.
