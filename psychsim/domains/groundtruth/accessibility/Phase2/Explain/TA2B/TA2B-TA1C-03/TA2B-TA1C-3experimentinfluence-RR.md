# Specific question #
We are conducting a randomized controlled trial with 5 total conditions. From the total set of recruited participants split participants into:
Group0 - Control Group
Group1 - No Evacuating Friends Group
Group2 - 1 Evacuating Friend Group
Group3 - 2 Evacuating Friends Group
Group4 - 3 Evacuating Friends Group


Each participant will experience an entire hurricane season in the holocane system (luckily the holocane can conduct such a test very quickly at much faster than real time speeds). 
Each recruited participant will then experience the holocane independently. Their grouping simply refers to which experimental condition they will experience in the holocane. 


Group0 will experience the hurricane season without any contact from any friends. They are in an environment where they are making decisions for their household in isolation from any peers. 


Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 will all have access to 3 simulated friends. These simulated friends will have preprogrammed behaviors during the synthetic hurricane season. 


In Group1, out of the 3 simulated friends, none of the friends will ever evacuate in response to any hurricane (and friends will be able to communicate decisions in the usual way that friends do). The subject will make his/her own decisions but will be aware that none of his/her friends are evacuating. 


In Group2, out of the 3 simulated friends, just 1 of the friends (selected at random) will always evacuate in response to every hurricane (and will be able to communicate decisions in the usual way that friends do). The subject will make his/her own decisions but will be aware of 1 of his/her friends evacuating and 2 of them not evacuating. 


In Group3, out of the 3 simulated friends, exactly 2 of the friends (selected at random) will always evacuate in response to every hurricane (and will be able to communicate decisions in the usual way that friends do). The subject will make his/her own decisions but will be aware of 2 of his/her friends evacuating and 1 of them not evacuating. 


In Group4, out of the 3 simulated friends, all 3 of the friends will always evacuate in response to every hurricane (and will be able to communicate decisions in the usual way that friends do). The subject will make his/her own decisions but will be aware of all 3 of his/her friends evacuating. 


Data collection:
For each group, we would like to collect their demographics (Age Children Ethnicity Fulltime_Job Gender Pets Religion Residence Income_Level) and a full behavioral record (evacuate, shelter, stay home) for every day in the holocane simulator, plus a full outcome record for the participant (were they “injured” and on which day, did they suffer any loss of income and on which days, did their simulated property get damaged and when and how much cost). We would also like to collect the respondents' daily level of satisfaction with the government. If the holocane simulates government aid responses, then please include the records of where and when aid was given. Also include the data on the simulated hurricanes; i.e. where the hurricane was each day and the category of the storm. 


# Sampling strategy #
Please recruit the largest percentage of the population in each of the 3 explain areas that is allowed uniformly at random from the total population if each. For the recruits from each area, assign each particular recruit alternatively to Group 0, 1, 2, and 3, cycling through that list until all recruits have been assigned into a single experimental condition group.




# Other applicable detail #
If a full hurricane season would result in too long of time spent in the holocane simulator, then please run as long a session as would be allowed and report what fraction of a usual season was simulated.
