# Specific question #


The agents in the 4aid-RR holocane experiment experienced a full hurricane season in which some of them suffered income losses and injuries and inconveniences due to simulated hurricanes (as well as experiencing different aid policies as part of the experiment). Yet, none of the participant ever report any movement in their initial level of satisfaction with government response to hurricanes throughout the experiment. How is this possible that satisfaction remained constant throughout the simulated season? Please confirm whether the data collected is valid, and if so, please discuss any potential limitations of the holocane test platform.
