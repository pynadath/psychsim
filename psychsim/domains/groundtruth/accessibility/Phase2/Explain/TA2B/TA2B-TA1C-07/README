Q7 and Q9 are phrased as yes/no questions that are not really answerable. We rephrase them as asking participants for the maximum category of the hurricanes as far as they know.

Q11 and Q12 refer to the entire season, but we interpret them as referring only to the most recent hurricane, to be consistent with all of the other questions.

We omit Q17, as it appears to be a duplicate of Q10.
