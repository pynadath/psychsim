This request is formulated in a way as to be aimed at the simulation designers, not its inhabitants. We have interpreted the items as a survey instead, as follows:

Q1. What is your current level of physical health? (1-7 scale, with 1 being the least healthy and 7 being the most healthy)

Q2-Q4. This item should be re-written to ask about specific emotions.

Q5. Distinctions among "Wealth" and "Pets" are not available.

Q6. How does the value of your possessions compare to those of your neighbors? (1-7 scale, with 1 being the lowest value and 7 being the highest value)

Q7-Q8. Insurance policies do not exist.

Q9. How certain were you about where the most recent hurricane was going to hit (i.e., what regions and what time) when it first formed? (1-7 scale, with 1 being the least certain and 7 being the most certain)

Q10. How certain were you as to what the category of the most recent hurricane might be when it first formed? (1-7 scale, with 1 being the least certain and 7 being the most certain)

We sampled 10% of the population at the end of the IDP in the Phase 2 Explain instances.
