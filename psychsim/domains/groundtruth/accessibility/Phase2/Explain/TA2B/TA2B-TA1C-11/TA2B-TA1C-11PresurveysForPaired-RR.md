# Specific Question #


We would like to study, using the same Paired Survey respondents, the participant’s perceptions of risk prior to the hurricane events and how those risk perceptions relate to the outcomes of prior hurricanes. 


Please collect pre-hurricane surveys (specifically the same pre-hurricane survey questions in the Challenge 2 Explain IDP) on the same respondents to the 2PairedPredictSurveys-RR. 




# Sampling Strategy #


Please sample the same respondents as used in the request, 2PairedPredictSurveys, and ask each of those respondents to fill out a Pre-Hurricane survey on a date that precedes the hurricane they filled a post-hurricane survey for. The result will be a set of pre-hurricane survey responses with one survey for every post-hurricane survey response that is in the 2PairedPredictSurveys dataset.
