Brief from Expert Observers in the Field

# Specific question #

1. Please visit each region in the aftermath of each hurricane, and report on the following for each of the aftermath timesteps:
a. What is the total damage to buildings in the region (scale of 0-6, where 0 is no visible damage, and 6 is completely destroyed)
b. What is the total estimated cost to rebuild or repair the buildings in the region, in dollars?
c. What is the total damage to shelters in the region (scale of 0-6, where 0 is no visible damage, and 6 is completely destroyed)?
d. If shelter capacity has been reduced by hurricane damage, what is the current capacity of shelters in the region? (report this as a percentage of total shelter capacity, where 0% is no capacity, and 100% is the maximum capacity)
e. What is the total damage to hospitals in the region (scale of 0-6, where 0 is no visible damage, and 6 is completely destroyed)?
f.If hospital capacity has been reduced by hurricane damage, what is the current capacity of hospitals in the region (report this as a percentage of total shelter capacity, where 0% is no capacity, and 100% is the maximum capacity)?
g. What is the total damage to transportation links in the region, including damage to vehicles like locomotives and airplanes (scale of 0-6, where 0 is no visible damage, and 6 is completely destroyed)? 
h. If transportation capacity has been reduced by hurricane damage, what is the current capacity of transport links in the region (report this as a percentage of total shelter capacity, where 0% is no capacity, and 100% is the maximum capacity)? This is effectively the evacuation capacity of the region.
i. What is the total damage to shipping infrastructure in the region (scale of 0-6, where 0 is no visible damage, and 6 is completely destroyed)?
j. If the capacity of shipping infrastructure has been reduced by hurricane damage, what is the current capacity of shipping infrastructure in the region for transporting supplies and food resources (report this as a percentage of total shelter capacity, where 0% is no capacity, and 100% is the maximum capacity)?

# Sampling strategy #
The expert observers visit each region during each hurricane and during the aftermath of each hurricane in the IDP, until the next hurricane to hit that region. That is to say, if a hurricane affected region 3 in timesteps 2-4, and the next hurricane in that region began in timestep 13, an expert observer would report on the damage in Region 3 in each of the timesteps beginning at step 2 and ending at step 12. The observers will provide a separate table with responses for the damage assessment questions for each such hurricane-region pair.
