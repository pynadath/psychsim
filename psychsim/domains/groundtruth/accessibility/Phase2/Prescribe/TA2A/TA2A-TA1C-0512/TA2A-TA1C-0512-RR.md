# Specific question #

1. What is the altitude of the sensor recorded by GPS (m)?
2. At each timestep, record the following information:
a. What is the temperature recorded by the sensor (C)?Ê
b. What is the wind speed recorded by the anemometer (kph)?
c. What is the wind direction recorded by the wind vane (cardinal / ordinal direction)?
d. What is the atmospheric pressure recorded by the barometer (kPa)?
e. What is the dew point depression (the difference between temperature and dew point) recorded by the sensor (C)?
f. What is the rainfall recorded by the rain gauge (mm)?
g. What is the magnitude of the slip-surface soil movements recorded by the sensor (mm)?
h. What is the soil moisture recorded by the sensor (% moisture in the soil)?
i. If a hurricane is approaching, what is the distance (recorded by radar) of the outer radial branches of the hurricane from the sensor (m)? If the hurricane has reached the sensor, record 0.


# Sampling strategy #

Place nine equally spaced all-purpose environmental sensors (barometric pressure, temperature, humidity, rainfall, etc.) in a grid pattern in each region at Timestep 1. Log data for each region at each timestep in the IDP.
