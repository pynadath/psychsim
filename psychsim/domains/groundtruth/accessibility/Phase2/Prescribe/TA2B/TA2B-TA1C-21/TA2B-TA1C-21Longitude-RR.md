# Sampling Strategy #


For instances 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 21.


First recruit the target actor (if there is a target actor associated with the IDP for that instance). 


Then select the maximum sized random sample of additional participants that may be drawn for this survey. If that equates to all agents, select all agents. If it equates to fewer than the entire population, then please select uniformly at random (without replacement) the largest random sample allowable. 


Request that actors answer about all the hurricanes he/she experience over the past hurricane season.
