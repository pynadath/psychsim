# Specific question #


Q1. For the prescribe question Short-term 1 - ConstrainedPrescriptionCasualties, we wish to check that the question “To which region should the government direct its aid on each day?” does this restrict to answers that specify a single region for each day that the government directs aid to? Alternatively, could this constrained prescription include policies where the government splits up its daily aid budget among multiple regions? Are we constrained to specifying a single region to receive aid each day? Also, if we refrain from giving aid to any of the regions on a particular day, does the undistributed amount become available to increase the aid distribution on another date?


Q2. We learned from the allowablePrescriptions CQ that subsidizing a behavior is allowed; for example subsidizing an agent’s evacuation expenses. The response simply said “Yes” that prescription is allowed. We wish to check whether any budgetary considerations are involved with evacuation subsidies? Would additional taxes need to be levied to support that? If aid distribution were reduced, would that allow for the subsidy program to be implemented? If budgets are indeed affected by broad subsidy programs for evacuation, please provide a guideline to the level of budgetary impact. 


Q3. We wish to check what percentage of the population could we deploy a demographic survey on. Is there any restriction to the number of residents we could ask to fill a demographic survey (age, gender, number in household, full time job, religion, ethnicity, pets, region, etc..)? If there is a restriction, what is the maximum percentage of the population allowed?


Q4. We are interested in asking agents to report all of the periods during the past hurricane season where they (A) were suffering from an injury, (B) were at a shelter, and (C) were evacuated from the area. That is to say, we would like agents to fill out a survey with start and end dates for each of these 3 states of being. Would agents be able to recall these dates (start and end times) over an entire past season? What is the maximum percentage of the population that can be surveyed to report this sort of information?


Q5. Would we be able to issue an experiment where agents from instance 20 and 21 experience an entire hurricane season (in the Holocane) where their evacuation expenses are subsidized? If not, would it be allowable if we asked for less than a full hurricane season to be experienced. Please describe the restrictions on such a study. Also, what is the maximum number of participants that can be recruited from each population for such a Holocane study?

Q1. We will allow multiple regions to be specified, in which case the original amount of aid will be divided uniformly among them (unless another division is specified). We will also allow a specification that aid be withheld on one day to be added to the distribution on the next.

Q2. A subsidy available to the entire population would reduce the aid distribution by half for that season. Subsidies available to only subsets of the population would scale the impact accordingly.

Q3. A census is available that provides demographic data across the entire population.

Q4. Such a survey could be applied to 10% of the population.

Q5. For the Predict and Prescribe phases, the HoloCane can only be run on past hurricanes. The default HoloCane experience replays the most recent hurricane. If a justification is provided for simulating more of the past season, we may extend the HoloCane period accordingly.
