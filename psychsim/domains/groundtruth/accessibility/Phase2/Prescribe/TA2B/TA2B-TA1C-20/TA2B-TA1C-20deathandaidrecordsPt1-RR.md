Government Data


# Specific question #
We would like to access government records about the circumstances of death of deceased individuals, as well as government records on aid expenditures


1. Timestep of death
2. When they died were they at home? In a shelter? Evacuated?
3. Was their death noted as a consequence of a hurricane (or actions they took due to a hurricane)?
3. Prior to their death, in the most recent hurricane, had the deceased individual chosen to stay home through the storm, evacuate the region, or go to the nearest shelter during the storm.
4. Were they currently injured when the hurricane arrived in their region of residence?
5. What was the category of the hurricane when it reached their region of residence?
6. For the entire past hurricane season, prior to the death of the individual, what was their action for all of the hurricanes: list whether they stayed at home, sheltered, or evacuated for each (if this information is available).
7. For the entire past hurricane season, prior to the death of the individual, what was their injury status (injured vs not injured) after each hurricane?
8. We request all government records that pertain to the distribution of aid in each instance. At a minimum we expect to obtain the dates and regions where aid was distributed on each day of the past hurricane season. If amount information on the aid is available include that information in each aid distribution record. 


# Sampling strategy #
Please provide this data for all regions and all dead agents for Instances 20 and 21, covering all of the time period provided in the IDP data. 


# Other applicable detail #


Give all of these agents unique IDs in the following way: An example name is D112-1, where D stands for died, 112 stands for died on date 112, -1 means they are the 1st person to die that day (another example, D43-5 would be the 5th person to die on day 43). 


Provide additional tables that map the above decedentID to the pre-hurricane survey respondent number or the post-hurricane survey respondent IDs that are used in the IDP datasets for the cases where the decedent had filled pre or post surveys. You can put these mappings in a relationshipdatatable mapping decedentID to the “ActorPre 1 Hurricane 1” for example.
