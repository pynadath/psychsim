# Specific question #


We would like to access government records about deceased individuals 
1. Gender
2. Age
3. Ethnicity (either majority or minority)
4. Religion (either majority, minority, or none)
5. Number of children/dependents in the household
6. Wealth (on a 0-7 scale, increasing from 0 to 7)
7. Pet owned or not
8. Full time job or not
9. Region of residence


# Sampling strategy #
Please provide this data for all regions and all dead agents for Instances 20 and 21, covering all of the time period provided in the IDP data. 


# Other applicable detail #


Give all of these agents unique IDs in the following way: An example name is D112-1, where D stands for died, 112 stands for died on date 112, -1 means they are the 1st person to die that day (another example, D43-5 would be the 5th person to die on day 43). 


Provide additional tables that map the above decedentID to the pre-hurricane survey respondent number or the post-hurricane survey respondent IDs that are used in the IDP datasets for the cases where the decedent had filled pre or post surveys. You can put these mappings in a relationshipdatatable mapping decedentID to the “ActorPre 1 Hurricane 1” for example.
