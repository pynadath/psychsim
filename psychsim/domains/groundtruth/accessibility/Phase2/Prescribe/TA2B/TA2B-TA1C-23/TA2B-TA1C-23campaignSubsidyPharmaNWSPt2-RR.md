Experiment


# Specific question #


We would like to submit the following holocane experiment.


Recruit the largest groups of participants possible uniformly at random. Please recruit the maximum allowed, so that if everyone in the society can be recruited recruit everyone.


For Condition 0, have them experience the period of hurricanes in the holocane with no changes to the current tax policy.


For Condition 1, have them experience the period of hurricanes in a holocane environment modified so that they will experience all of the following 4 changes: (1) an info campaign to tell them that evacuation is NECESSARY and expected of all good citizens and all of their most admired cultural figures prefer to evacuate, (2) a national weather service tells them accurate predictions of the storm track and severity, (3) they are exposed to a psychoactive drug in their drinking water that makes them more risk averse and (4) they are subsidized for their evacuation expenses such that they know ahead of time that the government will reimburse such expenses. 


Demographics Data Collection:
For each agent, upon enrollment, please provide all IDP demographic data; including, gender, age, ethnicity, religion, number of dependents, wealth (on a 0-7 scale), pet owned, full time job, and region of residence, number of friends.
(Ensure that this data is collected on the date where they begin to experience the holocane experiment, prior to experiencing that experiment.) 




# Sampling strategy #


Recruit participants in instances 20 and 21. Please recruit the largest sample allowable.
If allowed, recruit the target actors for instance 20 and 21 to be among the participants. 


Have the same set of recruited participants first experience the Condition 0 hurricane experiment and then, after an adequate rest period, experience the Condition 1 hurricane experiment. 


For Instances 20 and 21, have Conditions 0 and 1 both involve experiencing a simulation of as many hurricanes as are allowed from the past season of the IDP, matched to the characteristics of those hurricanes.


Provide additional tables that map the above agentID to the pre-hurricane survey respondent number or the post-hurricane survey respondent IDs that link the agent to the IDP respondents, for any agents who responded to either a pre- or post- hurricane survey in the IDP.
