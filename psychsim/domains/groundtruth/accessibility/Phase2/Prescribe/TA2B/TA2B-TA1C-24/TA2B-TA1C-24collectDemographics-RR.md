# Specific question #


We would like to submit the following survey.


Demographics Data Collection:
For each agent, ask them to provide all the demographic data; specifically:
1. gender, 
2. age, 
3. ethnicity, 
4. religion, 
5. number of dependents, 
6. wealth (on a 0-7 scale), 
7. pet owned, 
8. full time job 
9. region of residence, 
10. The number of days you spent in an injured state during the last hurricane season. 


# Sampling strategy #


Recruit the maximum number of possible participants in instances 20 and 21. Please recruit the largest sample allowable; we would especially like to obtain a 100% response rate on these demographics. However, if a 100% response is not feasible, please start with recruiting all residents who were injured during the last hurricane season. 


You may assign new unique identifiers to these respondents. 


For those actors that are part of the IDP surveys, please provide additional tables that map the above agentID to the pre-hurricane survey respondent number or the post-hurricane survey respondent IDs that link the agent to the IDP respondents, for any agents who responded to either a pre- or post- hurricane survey in the IDP. 


# Other applicable detail #


If any portion of this request restricts the number of respondents, please remove that portion of the request so that we can obtain the maximum response rate allowed.
