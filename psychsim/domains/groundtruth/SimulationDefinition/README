We apologize for the mixup in the files. Some clarifying comments:

* The short-term IDP spans seven hurricanes, and we ask for prescriptions regarding the eighth (whose track is provided in the InstanceVariableTable).

* The long-term IDP spans an entire season, containing six hurricanes and roughly the same number of days as in the short-term IDP (which led to our upload error). We ask for prescriptions to span the following season, beginning a year from day 1 of the IDP.

* There is no question 3e for the long-term prescription.
