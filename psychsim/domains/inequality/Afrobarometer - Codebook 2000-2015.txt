* Recoded entirely: codes of round 6-5 are used. Round 3 was recoded to have the same codes. Groups that occurred in more
than one round are kept. Also groups that occurred in one round but contained +50 respondents were preserved. When groups
were smaller but clearly part of a bigger group, we integrated those groups. Other groups (N<50) were added to the category
‘others’. See appendix for syntax of recoding.
